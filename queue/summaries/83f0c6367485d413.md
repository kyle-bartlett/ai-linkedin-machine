Thanks for the update! GPT-5.1’s new features like faster adaptive reasoning, extended prompt caching, improved coding performance, and the addition of apply_patch and shell tools sound like significant enhancements. If you’d like, I can help you explore how to leverage these capabilities in your projects or provide examples of using the new tools. Just let me know!
