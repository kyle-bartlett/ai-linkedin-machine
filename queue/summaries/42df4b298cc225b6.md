The paper titled with arXiv ID **2506.05577v3** presents **MOSAIC** (Modular Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning), a novel algorithm designed for improving learning in multi-agent systems with agentic AI, where agents autonomously set goals and adapt over time.

### Key Contributions and Ideas:

- **Problem Addressed**:  
  In multi-agent systems facing diverse and unforeseen tasks, agents benefit from sharing previously learned knowledge/policies. However, deciding *what* knowledge to share, *from whom* to learn, and *how* to integrate external policies is still a largely open challenge.

- **Proposed Solution - MOSAIC**:  
  MOSAIC introduces a framework for knowledge sharing that includes:  
  1. **Knowledge Selection**: Leveraging performance signals and similarity metrics on task embeddings (specifically, cosine similarity on Wasserstein embeddings) to decide which policies from other agents are relevant and beneficial.  
  2. **Modular Neural Representations**: Using masks to create modular, transferable components inside neural networks, facilitating flexible reuse and integration of knowledge.  
  3. **Policy Integration & Fine-Tuning**: Combining external policies with an agent’s existing knowledge through composition and additional training to adapt and optimize.

- **Results**:  
  MOSAIC agents learn faster and achieve superior performance compared to isolated agents and those using global sharing methods. In some scenarios, MOSAIC enables solving tasks that isolated agents cannot handle alone. The system also reduces negative interference between tasks, showing robustness in goal-driven knowledge reuse.

- **Emergent Phenomena**:  
  The study observes self-organization within the agent collective, where agents mastering simpler tasks help accelerate learning for agents tackling more complex tasks through shared policy components.

### Significance:

This work advances collective learning in agentic AI by providing practical methods for selective and modular knowledge transfer, improving efficiency and capabilities in multi-agent environments. The approach balances exploration and exploitation of shared knowledge, bringing closer the vision of adaptive, collaborative AI systems.
