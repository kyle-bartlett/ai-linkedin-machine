SimpleQA is a benchmark designed to evaluate the factual accuracy of language models when answering straightforward, fact-based questions. It typically consists of short questions that expect concise, fact-seeking answers. The goal of SimpleQA is to measure how well a model can retrieve or generate factual information without hallucination or error.

In practice, SimpleQA benchmarks assess:

- **Answer correctness:** Whether the model's answer matches the verified factual answer.
- **Precision:** The answer should be precise and not overly verbose or vague.
- **Relevance:** The response must be relevant and directly address the question.

SimpleQA is useful for evaluating the factual grounding of language models, especially those intended for QA tasks or information retrieval. It can help identify weaknesses where models might produce plausible-sounding but incorrect answers.
