That's an exciting development! The "OpenAI for Greece" initiative, which brings ChatGPT Edu into secondary schools, has the potential to significantly enhance AI literacy among young learners. By integrating AI education early, students can develop critical skills in understanding and using AI responsibly. Additionally, supporting local start-ups through this partnership can foster innovation and entrepreneurship, contributing to Greece’s economic growth. If you'd like, I can provide more information on how such programs typically work, or suggest ways educators can integrate ChatGPT into their curricula.
