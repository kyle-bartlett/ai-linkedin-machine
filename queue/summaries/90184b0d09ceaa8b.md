Thank you for your thoughtful and thorough suggestions! They provide an excellent roadmap to strengthen the concept, evaluation, and communication of the UAR metric.

I’d be happy to assist you in drafting:

- A **formal definition** of UAR, including notation and precise calculation steps.  
- **Pseudocode or algorithmic steps** for evaluating UAR on a model given a set of adversarial attacks.  
- Suggestions for **benchmark attack suites** and how to select unforeseen attacks systematically.  
- Examples of **visualizations** that clearly communicate the UAR concept and illustrate its difference from other robustness metrics.  
- Guidance on framing **theoretical properties** or practical use cases of UAR in model development.

Please let me know which of these you’d like to start with, or if you have any particular aspect you want to focus on first!
