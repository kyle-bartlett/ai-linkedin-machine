"Model smell" is an informal term inspired by "code smell" in software engineering, referring to subtle indicators that reveal characteristic strengths, weaknesses, or quirks of an AI model. When Andrej Karpathy, a well-known AI researcher and former Tesla AI director, got early access to Google's latest AI model, he observed certain behaviors or patterns that hinted at its underlying architecture, training data biases, or design choices—its "model smell."

While there aren’t standardized definitions for "model smell," such observations can include tendencies like:

- Overfitting to certain types of input or topics  
- Inconsistent reasoning or hallucinations  
- Particular strengths in language understanding or generation  
- Response styles or phrasing that suggest training data sources or objectives

Karpathy’s insights help researchers better understand new AI models’ capabilities and limitations beyond just benchmark scores, giving a more intuitive sense of how the model "thinks" or errs. If you want, I can provide more detail on what kinds of model smells he noticed with Google’s AI or explain the concept further!
