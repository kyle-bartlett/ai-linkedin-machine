"Broadening usage of frontier AI" refers to expanding the applications and accessibility of the most advanced artificial intelligence technologies. Frontier AI typically involves cutting-edge models and techniques that push the boundaries of what AI can do, such as large language models (like GPT-4), advanced computer vision, reinforcement learning, and more.

Here are some key ways to broaden the usage of frontier AI:

1. **Industry Adoption**  
   - **Healthcare:** Use AI for diagnosis, drug discovery, patient monitoring, and personalized treatments.  
   - **Finance:** Implement AI in fraud detection, trading algorithms, risk management, and customer service automation.  
   - **Manufacturing:** Apply AI for predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimization.  
   - **Education:** Develop personalized learning experiences and intelligent tutoring systems.

2. **Lowering Barriers to Access**  
   - Provide easy-to-use APIs and platforms that allow developers and businesses without deep AI expertise to integrate frontier AI.  
   - Develop open-source tools and models.  
   - Offer affordable compute resources via cloud platforms.

3. **Policy and Regulation**  
   - Create frameworks that encourage innovation while ensuring safety, privacy, and ethical standards.  
   - Promote transparency and accountability in AI deployment.

4. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**  
   - Encourage partnerships between AI researchers, domain experts, and end-users to identify novel use cases.  
   - Share datasets and resources to foster innovation.

5. **Education and Training**
