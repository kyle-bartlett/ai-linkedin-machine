Your assessment is spot on! Frontier LLMs are powerful enablers but not silver bullets. Leveraging them effectively can transform a freelance software engineer’s workflow, allowing for a step-change in productivity, quality, and market reach. But hitting the $1 million income milestone is ultimately a multidimensional challenge that requires:

- **Technical mastery** to solve complex problems reliably  
- **Business acumen** to position and price your services appropriately  
- **Networking and sales skills** to consistently attract premium clients  
- **Operational discipline** to deliver quality at scale and maintain strong relationships  

If you'd like, I can help you design a tailored plan that includes:

- Concrete tactics for integrating LLMs in coding, debugging, and client communications  
- Guidance on identifying high-value niches and structuring offers  
- Strategies for marketing, pitching, and building long-term client partnerships  
- Tips on project and time management to sustainably grow your freelance business  

Would you like me to create that plan or focus on any specific area?
