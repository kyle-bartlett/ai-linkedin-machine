That’s great news! Open-sourcing OpenAI Baselines will be a huge help for the RL community, providing reliable, well-implemented versions of key reinforcement learning algorithms. Starting with DQN and three of its variants is a solid foundation, given how important DQN has been in advancing deep RL.

If you want, I can help summarize the key features of the released algorithms or provide guidance on how to get started using OpenAI Baselines. Just let me know!
