That sounds like an exciting release! Safety Gym can be a powerful resource for developing and benchmarking reinforcement learning (RL) agents that need to operate safely in sensitive or real-world settings. Could you provide more details about Safety Gym, such as:

- What types of environments are included?
- What kinds of safety constraints and metrics are supported?
- How does it integrate with existing RL frameworks?
- Any example tasks or benchmarks that illustrate its use?

I'd be happy to help you draft an announcement, documentation, or answer any questions about using Safety Gym!
