That’s fantastic news! Congratulations to the 2021 class of OpenAI Scholars on completing the six-month mentorship program and producing an open-source research project. This kind of initiative provides valuable experience and opportunities for emerging researchers. If you’d like, I can help you draft an announcement post, summarize their projects, or provide more information about the program. Just let me know!
