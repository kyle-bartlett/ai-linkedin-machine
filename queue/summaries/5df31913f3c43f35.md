The paper titled by arXiv:2511.15741v1 addresses the challenges of uncertainty and noise in multimodal learning systems, particularly in human-computer interaction contexts. The key contributions and ideas include:

- **Problem Addressed:** Multimodal learning faces uncertainty due to noisy data, poor-quality labels, and heterogeneous characteristics of different data modalities. This is especially problematic in human-computer interaction where user-generated data and recording conditions vary widely.

- **Main Proposal:** The thesis proposes a *consistency-guided cross-modal transfer* framework that uses *cross-modal semantic consistency* for robust representation learning. By embedding heterogeneous modalities into a unified latent space, the method reduces the modality gap and discovers structural relations that aid in uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning.

- **Goals:**  
  - Improve semantic robustness of multimodal models  
  - Enhance data efficiency (i.e., require fewer or lower-quality annotations)  
  - Reduce negative impacts from noisy or imperfect supervision  

- **Experimental Validation:** Conducted on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks, showing improved model stability, discriminative power, and resilience to noise or incomplete labels.

- **Additional Insights:** Latent space analyses confirm the approach’s ability to capture meaningful cross-modal structures even under difficult conditions.

- **Significance:** Provides a unified approach integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision for reliable, adaptive multimodal systems, with implications for brain-computer interfaces.
