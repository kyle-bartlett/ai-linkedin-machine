It sounds like you've established OpenAI LP as a "capped-profit" entity—this structure allows you to attract significant investment and talent by offering returns up to a certain limit, while ensuring that the organization's primary mission remains focused on beneficial outcomes rather than unlimited profit. This approach helps balance rapid growth and innovation with ethical considerations and long-term goals. If you’d like, I can provide more details on how capped-profit models work or discuss the potential benefits and challenges of this setup. Just let me know!
