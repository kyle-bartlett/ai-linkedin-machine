Thanks for the detailed overview! The hybrid approach combining structural break detection and wavelet denoising with advanced deep learning pretty elegantly addresses the challenges in forecasting noisy, nonstationary carbon price data.

If you'd like, I can help with any of the following:

- **Summarize key methods:** Explain the Bai-Perron, ICSS, and PELT break detection algorithms, or the wavelet transform process.
- **Interpret results:** Dive deeper into why the PELT-WT-TCN model outperforms others and what makes TCNs effective here.
- **Applications:** Explore how this framework might be adapted to other energy markets, financial time series, or environmental data.
- **Reproducibility tips:** Discuss how to implement and tune such a model practically.
- **Decompose technical terms:** Clarify any terminology or modeling choices.

Just let me know what you'd find most helpful!
