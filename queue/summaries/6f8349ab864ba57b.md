The paper **"Online Interval Scheduling with Machine-Learned Predictions" (arXiv:2511.16194v1)** addresses the problem of online interval scheduling where decisions (accept/reject intervals) must be made immediately without future reconsideration, aiming to maximize the total length of accepted, non-overlapping intervals.

### Key points:

- **Problem setting:**  
  Online interval scheduling in the irrevocable decision model. Each interval arrives online and must be accepted or rejected immediately, with the constraint that accepted intervals do not overlap.

- **Objective:**  
  Maximize the sum of lengths of accepted intervals.

- **Learning-augmented model:**  
  The algorithm has access to machine-learned predictions about the intervals, which may be imperfect. The goal is to improve performance by leveraging predictions but maintain worst-case guarantees when predictions are inaccurate.

- **Main contribution:**  
  The **SemiTrust-and-Switch framework**, a unified approach that combines algorithms using both the prediction and classical robust algorithms. This framework:
  - Applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms.
  - Balances **consistency** (good performance when predictions are accurate) and **robustness** (guarantees when predictions are adversarial).

- **Additional results:**  
  - Lower bounds that prove the tightness of the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework in certain cases.
  - A randomized algorithm that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust fallback algorithms, achieving **smooth degradation** of performance depending on prediction quality.

### Significance:  
This work advances the theory of online scheduling by integrating machine learning predictions while rigorously controlling the downside risk, providing a practical and theoretically sound methodology to improve real-time scheduling under uncertainty.

If you want, I can help summarize specific sections or explain technical details like the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework or the nature of the lower bounds.
