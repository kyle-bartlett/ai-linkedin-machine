**Introducing OpenAI for Government: Empowering Public Servants with Advanced AI**

We’re proud to launch **OpenAI for Government**, a new initiative dedicated to bringing our most advanced AI technologies directly to public servants across the United States. By partnering with government agencies, we aim to accelerate the adoption of best-in-class AI tools that enhance decision-making, improve public services, and drive innovation for the public good.

Our commitment is to support the U.S. government in responsibly deploying AI solutions that:

- Strengthen public sector efficiency and effectiveness  
- Enable data-driven, transparent policy-making  
- Enhance constituent engagement and access to government services  
- Address critical challenges in areas such as health, safety, environment, and education  

Through OpenAI for Government, we offer tailored tools, expert support, and collaboration opportunities designed to meet the unique needs of government teams at federal, state, and local levels.

Together, we can harness the power of AI to build smarter, more responsive government for every community.
