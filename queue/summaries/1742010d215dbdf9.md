That’s great! A well-crafted Raising Concerns Policy not only encourages a culture of openness and accountability but also ensures employees feel safe to report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. Here’s a basic outline and some key points you might want to include in your policy, along with a sample draft:

---

### Raising Concerns (Whistleblowing) Policy

#### 1. **Purpose**
To provide a clear framework that enables employees to raise concerns about wrongdoing in the workplace safely, knowing they will be protected in accordance with applicable laws.

#### 2. **Scope**
This policy applies to all employees, including permanent, temporary, contract staff, and agency workers.

#### 3. **Definition of a Protected Disclosure**
A protected disclosure is when an employee raises a concern about suspected wrongdoing that they reasonably believe is true. This includes:
- Criminal offences  
- Failure to comply with legal obligations  
- Miscarriages of justice  
- Danger to health and safety  
- Damage to the environment  
- Deliberate concealment of any of the above  

#### 4. **Raising a Concern**
- Employees are encouraged to raise concerns internally first, through their line manager or designated safeguarding officer.
- If the employee feels unable to raise the issue internally, external channels (e.g., regulatory bodies) can be used.
- Concerns can be raised orally or in writing.

#### 5. **Confidentiality**
- All concerns will be treated confidentially.
- The identity of the whistleblower will not be disclosed without their consent unless required by law.

#### 6. **Protection from Retaliation**
- Employees making a protected disclosure will be protected from any form of retaliation, victimisation, or harassment.
- Any retaliation will be treated as a serious disciplinary offense.

#### 7. **Investigation Process**
- All raised concerns will be promptly and thoroughly investigated.
- The employee will be kept informed about the progress and outcome as appropriate.

#### 8. **Support**
- Employees may be offered support during and after the raising of a concern, including counselling services if necessary.

#### 9. **Monitoring and Review**
- The policy will be regularly reviewed to ensure it remains effective and up to date.
