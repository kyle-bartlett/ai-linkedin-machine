The paper "Active Measurement: Human-in-the-Loop AI for Scientific Measurement" (arXiv:2507.01372v2) proposes a novel framework to integrate AI and human expertise for more accurate and statistically reliable scientific measurements. Key points include:

- **Problem:** Pure AI workflows often lack the statistical guarantees and precision necessary for scientific applications.
- **Solution:** Introduce an active measurement framework where an AI model predicts measurements, and human labeling is selectively applied on samples chosen via importance sampling.
- **Process:** 
  1. AI predicts measurements for all units.
  2. A subset of units is sampled for human labeling, prioritizing informative or uncertain samples.
  3. Human labels update the AI model.
  4. The updated model and sampled labels produce unbiased Monte Carlo estimates of the total measurement.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Achieves precise estimates even if the AI model is initially imperfect.
  - Minimizes human effort when AI predictions are accurate.
- **Contributions:** New estimators, weighting schemes, and confidence intervals tailored for active measurement.
- **Results:** Demonstrated reduced estimation errors in multiple measurement tasks compared to standard methods.

This human-in-the-loop strategy effectively combines AI scalability with human accuracy and statistical rigor to enhance scientific data analysis.
