The paper corresponding to arXiv:2511.16081v1 presents a study on spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and proposes new approaches to address their limitations, specifically heterophily and over-smoothing, which arise from the static and low-pass nature of classical spectral filters like those used in ChebyNet.

### Key points from the abstract:

1. **Background problem:**
   - Spectral GNNs, such as ChebyNet, typically use static low-pass filters.
   - These filters struggle with heterophily (graphs where connected nodes have different labels/features) and suffer from over-smoothing when stacking many layers.

2. **Proposed solution: Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filters (AOPF):**
   - This class of filters generalizes spectral GNN filters via orthogonal polynomials.
   - Two new models working in the spectral domain \([-1, 1]\) are introduced:
     - **L-JacobiNet:** An adaptive generalization of ChebyNet with learnable parameters \(\alpha, \beta\), which shape the Jacobi polynomial filter.
     - **S-JacobiNet:** A novel, static baseline that applies Layer Normalization to stabilize the static ChebyNet filter.

3. **Comparison of spectral domains:**
   - Analysis between filters operating on the \([-1,1]\) domain (Jacobi polynomials) and \([0, \infty)\) domain (e.g., LaguerreNet).
   - Findings:
     - The \([0, \infty)\) domain is better for modeling heterophily.
     - The \([-1, 1]\) domain offers better numerical stability at higher polynomial order \(K > 20\).

4. **Key discovery about ChebyNet:**
   - Contrary to prior belief, the main issue with ChebyNet is not that it uses a static filter but that it lacks stabilization.
   - The proposed static S-JacobiNet (ChebyNet + LayerNorm) actually outperforms the adaptive L-JacobiNet on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets.
   - Overfitting from adaptation might hinder L-JacobiNet's performance in the \([-1, 1]\) domain.

### Significance:

- This work identifies LayerNorm-based stabilization of spectral filters as a simple yet powerful technique to improve classical spectral GNNs without adding adaptive complexity.
- It also clarifies domain-related trade-offs and suggests that adaptivity is not always beneficial, especially when it leads to overfitting.
- The static S-JacobiNet serves as a strong baseline that future spectral GNNs should consider.
