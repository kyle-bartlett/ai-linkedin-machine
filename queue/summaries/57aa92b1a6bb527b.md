The paper with arXiv ID **2511.16027v1** presents a novel approach to solving **Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP)** problems, which are widely used for decision-making under uncertainty but become computationally challenging when many scenarios must be considered.

### Key Contributions:
- **Problem:** Current methods for scenario selection in 2SP mostly use clustering or Monte Carlo sampling but do not deeply incorporate scenario relationship information or consider the impact that the order of scenarios has on solver efficiency.
- **Proposed Solution:** The authors introduce **HGCN2SP**, a new model based on a **hierarchical graph convolutional network (HGCN)** that:
  - Encodes each scenario.
  - Hierarchically models relationships between scenarios.
  - Uses reinforcement learning with solver feedback to train the policy network.
  - Features an attention-based decoder for selecting representative scenarios in an optimal order.
- **Performance:** 
  - Demonstrated on two classic 2SP problems.
  - Achieves high-quality decisions quickly.
  - Shows strong generalization to large-scale problems with many more variables or scenarios than seen during training.

### Significance:
- Addresses a gap by integrating scenario relationship structure and scenario ordering, which improves computational efficiency.
- Uses a combination of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning.
- Enhances practical usability of 2SP methods, especially in large, complex scenarios.
