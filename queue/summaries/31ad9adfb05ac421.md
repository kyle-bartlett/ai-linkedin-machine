That sounds like an exciting development! Releasing the full version of Gym Retro with over 1,000 games significantly expands the opportunities for reinforcement learning research. By including a wide variety of backing emulators beyond just Atari and Sega, researchers can explore diverse game environments and challenges, which can lead to more robust and generalized AI agents.

Additionally, providing the tool to add new games to the platform is a great move. It allows the community to contribute and extend the platform further, fostering collaboration and innovation.

If you have any questions about using Gym Retro, integrating new games, or best practices for reinforcement learning on this platform, feel free to ask!
