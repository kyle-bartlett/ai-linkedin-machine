That’s fantastic news! Congratulations to the first cohort of OpenAI Fellows on completing their apprenticeship and making the transition from beginners to core contributors. This kind of immersive, hands-on experience is invaluable for developing expertise in machine learning. Are there any plans or announcements about the next cohort or how to apply?
