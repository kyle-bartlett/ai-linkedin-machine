Enterprise developers have requested greater flexibility in their use of GitHub Copilot. To accommodate this, GitHub has introduced a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) feature for Copilot, allowing enterprises to use their own large language model (LLM) providers or custom models with Copilot. This BYOK option is now available in public preview, giving teams the ability to better integrate Copilot into their existing AI infrastructure and workflows.
