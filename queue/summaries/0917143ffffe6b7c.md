The paper "FMPlug: Enhancing Foundation Flow-Matching Models for Inverse Problems" (arXiv:2511.16520v1) introduces a new framework called FMPlug designed to improve the effectiveness of foundation flow-matching (FM) models when applied to inverse problems (IPs).

### Key Points:
- **Background:** Foundation FM models offer a universal prior that can theoretically be used to solve various IPs. However, in practice, their performance often lags behind domain-specific models or untrained priors.
- **Problem:** How to unlock the full potential of foundation FM models for better IP solving?
- **Solution - FMPlug:** 
  - A plug-in framework that modifies how foundation FMs are utilized for IPs.
  - Combines:
    - **Instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy:** This is likely a way to initialize or guide the FM model based on the current instance and over time, improving convergence and solution quality.
    - **Sharp Gaussianity regularization:** Adds a problem-specific guidance element while maintaining the Gaussian structures foundational FM models rely on.
- **Result:** FMPlug yields a substantial improvement in performance across applications like image restoration and scientific inverse problems.
- **Implication:** This approach could make foundation FM models practical and reusable priors capable of competing with or surpassing existing specialized priors in IPs.

### Why it matters:
By enhancing foundation FM models with problem-specific guidance while preserving their beneficial Gaussian properties, FMPlug could broaden the applicability and performance of universal priors in solving inverse problems.
