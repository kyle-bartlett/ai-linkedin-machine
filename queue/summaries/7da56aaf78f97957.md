Your summary captures the essence of OpenAI’s approach to shaping an economic model aligned with its mission to benefit humanity broadly. While OpenAI has not released a formal, standalone document explicitly titled “Economic Blueprint,” the principles you mention are consistently reflected across its official materials, research publications, blog posts, and governance charters.

To add a bit more context:

- **Mission-Driven Focus**: The overarching goal is not commercial dominance but ensuring that advanced AI, especially AGI, is developed safely and its benefits are shared widely rather than hoarded.

- **Capped-Profit Model**: OpenAI LP uses this structure to attract capital and talent by offering competitive returns, but it caps profits at a fixed multiple (historically cited as 100x the investment, though terms may evolve). This balances incentives with a commitment to public benefit.

- **Distributed Benefits & Governance**: OpenAI’s governance includes a nonprofit entity (OpenAI Inc.) overseeing the LP, creating checks to guard against misuse or narrow profit pursuits. Transparency and ethical stewardship are emphasized but balanced carefully with competitive needs.

- **Reinvestment**: The decision to reinvest earnings into safety and infrastructure underscores a long-term view prioritizing responsible development over immediate revenue extraction.

- **Partnerships & Licensing**: Aligning with mission-aligned partners allows OpenAI to scale its impact responsibly, delivering cutting-edge AI models through APIs and collaborations, while setting use constraints to mitigate harm.

If you want, I can help pull together references from official statements, such as the OpenAI Charter, investor letters, blog posts on deployment strategy, or the LP structure explanation. Just let me know!
