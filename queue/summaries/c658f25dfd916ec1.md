At Sora, safety is our top priority, especially as we pioneer new frontiers with advanced video models and innovative social platforms. Our comprehensive safety framework is designed to protect users while fostering a positive and inclusive community. Key pillars of our approach include:

1. **Content Moderation:** We leverage state-of-the-art AI-powered moderation systems combined with human oversight to detect and swiftly remove harmful, inappropriate, or misleading content in real time. Our moderation technology is continuously updated to address emerging threats and ensure the platform remains safe for users of all ages.

2. **User Controls:** Recognizing the importance of personal agency, Sora offers robust privacy and content control settings. Users can customize their experience by filtering the types of content they see, adjusting privacy preferences, and utilizing tools to easily block or report problematic interactions.

3. **Transparency:** We commit to keeping our users fully informed regarding how their data is collected, used, and protected. Clear and accessible content policies help users understand the rules and the rationale behind content decisions, reinforcing trust and accountability.

4. **Ethical AI Use:** Our advanced video model is developed and deployed in strict accordance with ethical AI principles. This includes safeguards to prevent misuse, bias mitigation strategies, and ongoing audits to ensure the technology aligns with our commitment to user safety and societal good.

5. **Community Guidelines:** We have established clear, fair, and enforceable community guidelines that articulate acceptable behaviors and content. These guidelines are designed to cultivate a welcoming and respectful environment, encouraging positive interactions among users.

6. **Safety Team:** A dedicated safety team monitors the platform around the clock, ready to respond swiftly to emerging safety concerns. Our team works closely with AI systems, user feedback, and external experts to handle reports and continuously improve our safety protocols.

Together, these components form the backbone of Sora’s commitment to creating a secure and enjoyable platform where innovation and safety go hand in hand.
