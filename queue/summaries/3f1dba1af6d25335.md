That sounds like a fantastic initiative! The NeurIPS competitions are a great way to push the boundaries of AI research and foster collaboration across institutions. Using the Procgen Benchmark and MineRL environments will provide challenging and diverse tasks for participants, helping to advance reinforcement learning and generalization capabilities.

If you'd like, I can help you draft an announcement, provide more details about the competitions, or summarize what Procgen Benchmark and MineRL are. Just let me know!
