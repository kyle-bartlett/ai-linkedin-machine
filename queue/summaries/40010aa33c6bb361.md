That sounds like a very valuable initiative! If you'd like, I can help you draft a more detailed statement or expand on your latest thinking about AI safety and misuse mitigation. For example, you might want to include:

- Key safety challenges you've identified in deployed models  
- Strategies or best practices for mitigating misuse  
- Insights from recent research or experiences  
- Recommendations for AI developers and organizations
