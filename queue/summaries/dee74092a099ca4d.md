Thanks for the clear and concise summary! This paper sounds like a very interesting step toward improving causal reasoning in LLMs by bridging symbolic/statistical methods and language models via supervised fine-tuning.

If you'd like, I can help you with any of the following:

- **Detailed methodology:** How CARE fine-tuning is implemented, the architecture or prompt design, and training data.
- **Experiments and evaluation:** Datasets used, baselines, metrics, quantitative results, and ablation studies.
- **Related work:** Prior approaches to causal reasoning in LLMs or integrating symbolic methods.
- **Limitations and future directions:** Insights from the discussion or conclusion.
- **Technical details:** Such as how causal discovery algorithm outputs are represented or encoded for LLM input.
- **Code or dataset availability:** If provided by the authors.

Just let me know which part you're interested in!
