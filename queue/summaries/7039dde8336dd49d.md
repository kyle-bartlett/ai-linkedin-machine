Yes, you’ve summarized Klarna’s use of AI very well. To add a bit more context:

- **Customer Service**: Beyond handling routine queries, Klarna’s AI chatbots often incorporate natural language processing (NLP) to understand customer intent more accurately, providing more relevant responses and improving the overall user experience.

- **Employee Productivity**: AI-driven analytics tools can help Klarna identify patterns in customer behavior or operational data faster than traditional methods. This insight aids in strategic decision-making, risk management, and streamlining workflows.
