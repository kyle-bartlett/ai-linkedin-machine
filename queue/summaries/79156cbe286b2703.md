Yes, that's correct. Data residency enhances OpenAI's existing enterprise-grade data privacy, security, and compliance measures by allowing customers to specify the geographic location where their data is stored and processed. This capability is especially important for organizations that must comply with regional data sovereignty laws and regulations, ensuring that their data remains within certain jurisdictions. By supporting data residency, OpenAI helps customers meet these legal and regulatory requirements while maintaining robust security and privacy standards.
