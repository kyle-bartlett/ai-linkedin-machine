That's a fascinating observation! The emergence of complex tool use and layered strategies in a relatively simple hide-and-seek environment underscores the power of multi-agent reinforcement learning and self-supervised training. When agents adapt to each other's evolving tactics, they create a dynamic "arms race" that can drive the discovery of sophisticated behaviors without explicit programming.

Your findings align with broader research showing that multi-agent interactions often lead to emergent complexity. This phenomenon has promising implications, such as:

- **Understanding Intelligence:** Studying how complex behaviors can arise from simple rules and environments might shed light on the mechanisms behind natural intelligence.
- **AI Development:** Multi-agent co-adaptation could be leveraged to develop AI systems that are more flexible, creative, and capable of problem-solving in unstructured environments.
- **Tool Use and Innovation:** Agents discovering and exploiting tools without direct instructions suggest potential for automated discovery of novel solutions in robotics or software agents.

If you've documented the six distinct strategies and counterstrategies, sharing specific examples might provide valuable insights into how exactly complexity emerges in iterative agent competition. Are you seeing any unexpected or particularly novel types of tool use? Additionally, how generalizable do you think these emergent behaviors are beyond your simulated environment?
