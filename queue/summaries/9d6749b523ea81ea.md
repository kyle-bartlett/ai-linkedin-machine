The paper titled "**Scalable Gaussian Process Inference via Nested System Solutions**" (arXiv:2511.16340v1) addresses the challenge of improving the scalability of Gaussian processes (GPs) particularly for sequential decision-making tasks. The key contributions and ideas in this work are:

- **Context & Challenge:** Gaussian processes are widely used for probabilistic modeling but become computationally expensive as the dataset grows, especially when GPs need to be updated iteratively with new data (e.g., in Bayesian optimization or active learning).

- **Iterative GP Inference:** The paper focuses on iterative methods like conjugate gradients or stochastic gradient descent to solve the linear systems involved in GP posterior computations. These iterative solvers approximate the GP solution without directly computing expensive matrix inverses.

- **Main Idea - Nested Linear Systems:** It leverages the known solution of a smaller linear system (corresponding to a subset of data) to speed up the solution of a larger system (updated with more data). Essentially, this utilizes previously computed information to accelerate convergence when new data is added incrementally.

- **Benefits:** This approach provides faster convergence to the desired tolerance level and thus reduces the computational cost. It also leads to improved practical performance in Bayesian optimization, especially when computational resources are limited.

- **Significance:** The method is particularly important for sequential data scenarios where GPs must be updated repeatedly, making inference faster and more scalable in real-time or resource-constrained contexts.
