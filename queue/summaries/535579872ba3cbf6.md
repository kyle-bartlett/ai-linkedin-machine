This paper (arXiv:2511.06304v2) presents a comprehensive analysis of 15 years of data science activity on Kaggle, a widely known platform for data science competitions and collaboration. Key points from the abstract include:

- Kaggle has evolved from a competition-only platform to a rich ecosystem comprising forums, notebooks (code), models, datasets, and more.
- The release of Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets enables detailed exploration of competitions, technologies, and real-world machine learning applications hosted on Kaggle.
- The study analyzes millions of kernels (shared code notebooks) and discussion threads to perform longitudinal trend analysis and exploratory data analysis.
- Findings show steady growth of the platform, increasing diversity in use cases, and Kagglers’ quick adaptability to new technological trends.
- On average, Kaggle competitors produce models with strong generalization capabilities.
- The paper also provides insights into Kaggle’s history and technological evolution across 15 years.
- Additional resources accompanying the study include a YouTube video and a Kaggle write-up for further convenience.
