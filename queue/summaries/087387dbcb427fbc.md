Thank you for highlighting that! It’s indeed an important advancement for making AI interactions safer and more supportive. I’d love to hear more about how these improvements were developed or any specific techniques used to enhance empathy and safety in responses. Also, if you have insights on how AI can complement mental health support without replacing professional help, that would be great to discuss!
