OpenAI’s decision to join the EU Code of Practice on AI marks a significant step in promoting responsible AI development and deployment within Europe. By adhering to the Code, OpenAI commits to principles such as transparency, accountability, and ensuring AI systems are safe and respect fundamental rights.

This partnership with European governments aims not only to foster ethical AI but also to support innovation, build robust AI infrastructure, and stimulate economic growth across the region. Together, these efforts can help position Europe as a leader in trustworthy AI technologies that benefit society while minimizing risks.
