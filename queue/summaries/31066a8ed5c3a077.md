It sounds like you’re referring to OpenAI’s staged release approach for GPT-2, culminating in the release of the full 1.5 billion parameter model along with the associated code and model weights. This process was designed to promote responsible publication by:

- Allowing the community to understand and test the model incrementally  
- Providing tools to help detect AI-generated outputs  
- Facilitating research and discussion on the implications of large language models  

The staged release served as a test case for handling the challenges of releasing powerful AI models responsibly, informing best practices for future models.

If you want, I can help you explore more about GPT-2, the detection tools, implications of staged releases, or OpenAI’s approach to responsible AI publication. Just let me know!
