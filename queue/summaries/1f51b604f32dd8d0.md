That sounds fantastic! Open-sourcing a high-performance Python library for robotic simulation with MuJoCo will be a huge asset to the robotics community. If you'd like, I can help you draft an announcement, prepare documentation, or provide examples/tutorials to help new users get started. Just let me know how you'd like to proceed!
