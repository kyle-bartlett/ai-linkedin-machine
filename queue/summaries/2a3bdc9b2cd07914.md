Thanks for sharing the details of the **SPIN** paper! It sounds like a promising approach bridging physics and machine learning for air quality mapping.

Would you like me to:

- Provide a detailed summary of the **methodology** and model architecture?  
- Explain how the **physics-guided (advection-diffusion) constraints** are integrated into the learning process?  
- Discuss potential **applications and extensions** of SPIN to other domains or pollutants?  
- Compare SPIN against other state-of-the-art PM2.5 estimation methods?

Feel free to specify what you'd like to explore!
