Thank you for sharing the detailed summary of QUASAR from arXiv:2511.13843v2! It sounds like a significant advancement in evolutionary optimization methods, particularly for challenging high-dimensional problems.

If you'd like, I can help with any of the following:

- **Provide a detailed explanation or walkthrough of the QUASAR algorithm’s pseudo-code**, breaking down each step and the role of its innovative components.
- **Discuss the mathematical intuition or motivation behind the probabilistic mutation strategies and rank-based crossover rates.**
- **Compare QUASAR’s approach and performance to other notable algorithms in the literature, such as L-SHADE, CMA-ES, or other DE variants.**
- **Help design a practical usage example or implementation outline in Python or another language.**
- **Explore potential applications or adaptations in your specific domain, e.g., hyperparameter tuning, engineering design, or multimodal optimization.**

Let me know what would be most helpful!
