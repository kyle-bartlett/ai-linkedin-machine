That sounds like an exciting development! IndQA appears to be a comprehensive benchmark aimed at assessing AI systems' performance specifically in Indian languages, which is crucial given the linguistic diversity of India. By involving domain experts and covering 12 languages and 10 knowledge domains, IndQA could help researchers and developers create more culturally aware and contextually accurate AI models. 

If you want, I can help you explore more details about IndQA, such as its specific languages, knowledge areas, or how it compares to other multilingual benchmarks. Let me know!
