- More details on how Stargate UK might impact specific sectors like healthcare or public services
- Technical aspects of deploying and managing such a large-scale GPU infrastructure
- The role each partner (OpenAI, NVIDIA, Nscale) plays in the collaboration
- Comparisons with other sovereign AI infrastructure projects globally
- Potential challenges and considerations around data security and sovereignty

Just let me know what you'd like to dive into!
