Thank you for the thorough summary! This is an important and impressive advance in the theory of community detection for the symmetric \(k\)-SBM.

If you want, I can help with any of the following:

- A more detailed explanation of the **algorithmic approach** used in the paper, including how the Sum-of-Squares framework is applied to robustify majority voting.
- Breaking down the new **graph bisection method** and how it improves the misclassification rate step-by-step.
- Intuition behind the **Kesten-Stigum threshold** and why the rate \(\exp(-C/k)\) is minimax-optimal.
- Overview of the **adversarial corruption model** and what it means for the algorithm to tolerate \(\eta\) fraction of corrupted nodes.
- Connections and implications for related models like asymmetric SBM, degree-corrected SBM, or applications in network science.

Just let me know what aspect you're most interested in!
