The paper titled "Certified Unlearning Guarantees for Stochastic Descent-to-Delete and Rewind-to-Delete" (arXiv:2511.15983v1) investigates machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of particular training data points from a machine learning model without fully retraining it. The main contributions and findings include:

- **Focus on Two Algorithms:** The work centers on two full-batch gradient descent unlearning algorithms called Descent-to-Delete (D2D) and Rewind-to-Delete (R2D). These methods are both easy to implement and come with provable unlearning guarantees.

- **Stochastic Versions and Nonconvex Setting:** Although stochastic D2D is commonly used in practice as a "finetuning" unlearning baseline, prior to this work, it lacked theoretical guarantees on nonconvex loss functions. This paper fills that gap.

- **Certified Unlearning Guarantees:** The authors prove $(\epsilon, \delta)$-certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic versions of both R2D and D2D applicable to strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions.

- **Analysis Approach:** Their proofs leverage viewing unlearning as a disturbed or biased stochastic gradient system:
  - For **strongly convex** losses, the system is contracting.
  - For **convex** losses, it is semi-contracting.
  - For **nonconvex** losses, it can be expansive.
  
  Using optimal coupling of unlearning and retraining trajectories, they derive a probabilistic sensitivity bound that, combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism, achieves the certified guarantees.

- **Comparative Results:**
  - **D2D** benefits from contraction to a unique global minimum and thus provides tighter guarantees in the strongly convex case.
  - On the other hand, **R2D**, by reversing accumulated disturbances to bring the unlearned model closer to the retrained model, attains unlearning guarantees in the broader convex and nonconvex settings—where D2D fails to do so.

This work thus provides important theoretical foundations for practical machine unlearning methods, extending guarantees to stochastic settings and nonconvex losses, which are common in modern machine learning.
