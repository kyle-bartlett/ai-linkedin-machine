The paper with arXiv ID 2511.16164v1 presents a new forecasting pipeline that transforms ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power forecasts for lead times from 1 day up to 46 days at daily resolution. The key contributions and findings include:

- Addressing the challenge of longer-term wind power forecasting (beyond short-term predictions), which is critical for grid stability, supply-demand balancing, and managing market risk.
- Utilizing subseasonal-to-seasonal probabilistic weather forecasts, which typically require temporal and spatial aggregation for reasonable skill, and adapting them specifically to wind power prediction.
- Implementing post-processing of power forecast ensembles to correct biases and improve dispersion, thus enhancing forecast reliability.
- Demonstrating that their method outperforms a climatological baseline by 50% according to both Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS) and Ensemble Mean Squared Error (EMSE).
- Achieving near perfect calibration of forecasts, particularly for lead times ranging from 15 to 46 days.

This work opens promising avenues for extending operational wind power forecasting capabilities into the subseasonal range, improving predictive skill and reliability for better energy system management.
