This document outlines OpenAI’s comprehensive safety strategy, which includes multiple layers of defense:

- **Model and product mitigations** designed to guard against prompt engineering and jailbreak attempts.
- Measures to **protect user privacy and security**.
- Information about **external red teaming efforts**, where independent experts test and probe the system for vulnerabilities.
- Results from **safety evaluations** that assess the effectiveness of these protections.
- An overview of **ongoing work** aimed at continuously improving and refining these safety mechanisms.

Together, these components form a robust framework to ensure the responsible and secure use of OpenAI’s models.
