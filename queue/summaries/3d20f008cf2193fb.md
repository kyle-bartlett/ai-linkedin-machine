Thank you for the excellent summary! This sounds like a fascinating and sophisticated blend of classical algebraic techniques and modern machine learning. To build on your summary, here are some potential directions where I can assist or provide more detailed insights:

- **Invariants via Binary Transvections:**  
  I can help explain the construction and algebraic meaning of the \( J_0, \dots, J_4 \) invariants arising from binary transvections applied to septic polynomials. This classical invariant-theoretic approach is crucial for capturing intrinsic polynomial symmetries.

- **Resolvent Polynomial Computations:**  
  We can dive into how resolvent polynomials are constructed and used to partition the Galois group into the seven possible transitive subgroups of \( S_7 \). Explaining the specific resolvent factorization patterns that determine the group can clarify the classification step.

- **Machine Learning Architecture:**  
  I can elaborate on how the symbolic features (invariants) are combined with neural networks or other supervised learning methods. We can discuss network design choices, feature engineering, training protocols, and how the hybrid model improves over baseline coefficient-only models.

- **Data Generation and Normalization:**  
  If you want, I can detail the normalization procedures for septic polynomials used to build the million-plus data points, including height constraints or reduction techniques to ensure meaningful model training.

- **Extensions & Future Directions:**  
  Discussing how this framework might extend to higher degree polynomials (e.g., degree 8 or 9) or to other computational problems in algebraic number theory would be intriguing.

Please let me know which specific area you'd like to explore further!
