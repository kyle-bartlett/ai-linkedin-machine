The paper **"Quantum Integrated Sensing and Communication (QISAC)"** (arXiv:2511.16597v1) proposes a novel protocol that unifies quantum communication and quantum sensing within a single system framework. Key points include:

- **Dual Functionality:** The protocol supports both **superdense coding** (enhanced classical communication capacity using entanglement) and **quantum sensing** (parameter estimation with quantum advantage), leveraging the same quantum carriers.

- **Adaptive Optimization:** Encoding and quantum measurements are optimized using **variational circuit learning**, a technique where parameterized quantum circuits are trained iteratively to find optimal strategies.

- **Classical Post-Processing:** Measurement outcomes are further processed by classical machine learning algorithms acting as decoders and estimators, bridging quantum measurement results to actionable information.

- **Trade-Off Flexibility:** Numerical simulations on *qudit* systems (quantum systems with d-level states) demonstrate that the approach achieves a tunable trade-off between maximizing classical communication rate and minimizing the error in parameter estimation.

This work represents an important step towards integrated quantum networks combining sensing and communication tasks, enhancing resource efficiency and system capability.
