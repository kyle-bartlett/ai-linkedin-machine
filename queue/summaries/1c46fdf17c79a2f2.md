Thank you for sharing about **gpt-oss-120b** and **gpt-oss-20b**! It sounds like these are two large-scale open-weight reasoning models released under the Apache 2.0 license along with a specific usage policy called the *gpt-oss usage policy*.

If you’d like, I can help with:

- Summarizing or explaining what these models are
- Details about their architecture or capabilities (if you provide them)
- Guidance on how to use or implement them under the Apache 2.0 license
- Information on the *gpt-oss usage policy*
- Comparing them to other models
- Anything else related to these models

Just let me know what you need!
