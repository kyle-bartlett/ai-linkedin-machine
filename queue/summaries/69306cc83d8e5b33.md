This paper (arXiv:2511.16573v1) addresses a key challenge in using neural operators for time-dependent PDEs governed by conservation laws (e.g., conservation of mass, energy), which existing neural operators tend to violate, causing reduced accuracy and poor generalization.

### Key Contributions:
- **Problem:** Neural operators often fail to satisfy conservation properties inherent to many physical PDEs, leading to degraded performance.
- **Observation:** Different PDE problems typically require distinct neural network architectures, highlighting the limits of specialized models in generalizing across domains.
- **Proposed Solution:** The authors introduce the **Exterior-Embedded Conservation Framework (ECF)**, a universal framework that can be plugged into various neural operator models to ensure strict adherence to conservation laws in predictions.
  - **Conservation Quantity Encoder:** Extracts conserved physical quantities from input data.
  - **Conservation Quantity Decoder:** Adjusts the neural network’s outputs to strictly enforce conservation constraints.
- **Theoretical Guarantee:** The framework is proven theoretically to improve model performance by enforcing conservation.
- **Experiments:** Tested on multiple PDE problems with conservation constraints including:
  - Adiabatic systems
  - Shallow water equations
  - The Allen-Cahn equation
Results show improved accuracy and strict enforcement of conservation laws.

### Significance:
This framework helps neural operators better respect fundamental physical laws, enhancing reliability, accuracy, and generalization when modeling PDEs across various domains involving conservation principles.
