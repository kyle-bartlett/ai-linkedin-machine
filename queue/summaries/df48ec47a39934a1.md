Yes, that's correct! With the introduction of GPT-4o (GPT-4 turbo with multimodal capabilities), developers can fine-tune the model using both images and text. This advancement enables more specialized and enhanced vision capabilities tailored to specific applications.

Fine-tuning GPT-4o on combined visual and textual data allows the model to better understand and generate responses related to images—such as identifying objects, interpreting scenes, answering questions about images, or performing tasks that require integrated vision and language comprehension.

This development opens up many possibilities, including:
- Custom image recognition and analysis tools.
- Advanced multimodal chatbots that can see and understand pictures.
- Specialized vision-language applications in areas like healthcare, retail, education, and more.
