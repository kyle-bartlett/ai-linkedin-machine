This paper studies a novel version of the *k-means* clustering problem where the input is a set \(\mathcal{S}\) of \(n\) line segments in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), rather than points. The goal is to find \(k\) cluster centers \(X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d\) minimizing the total distance:

\[
D(\mathcal{S}, X) = \sum_{S \in \mathcal{S}} \min_{x \in X} D(S, x),
\]

where the distance from a segment \(S\) to a center \(x\) is defined as

\[
D(S, x) = \int_{p \in S} |p - x| \, dp,
\]

i.e., the integral of point-to-center distances along the segment.

### Contributions and Highlights

- **Problem Setting:** Extends classical \(k\)-means, traditionally defined on points, to a setting where input elements are line segments. This requires integrating distances continuously along segments rather than considering discrete points.

- **Variants:** The method can accommodate extensions such as:
  - Outlier handling,
  - Alternative distance metrics (e.g., M-estimators),
  - Weighted distances for balanced clustering,
  - and enforcing unique cluster assignments.

- **Coreset Construction:** The main theoretical contribution is the *first provable coreset construction* for arbitrary input segments.
  - A coreset here is a small, weighted subset \(C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d\) such that for any \(k\)-center set \(X\), the total distance to the coreset approximates that to the original segments within a factor of \(1 \pm \varepsilon\).
  - Such coresets enable efficient approximation algorithms suitable for:
    - Streaming data,
    - Distributed computing,
    - Parallelization.

- **Complexity:** For fixed \(k\) and \(\varepsilon\), the coreset size is \(O(\log^2 n)\), and it can be computed in \(O(nd)\) time, which is near-linear in input size and dimension.

- **Practical Validation:** Experiments, including a real-time video tracking application, demonstrate:
  - Substantial speedups in clustering computation,
  - Minimal loss of clustering accuracy,
  - Practical feasibility alongside theoretical guarantees.

### Why It Matters

This work generalizes \(k\)-means clustering to continuous geometric objects (segments), providing scalable and well-grounded methods via coresets. It opens doors for clustering in problems with structured spatial data beyond points, relevant in computer vision, tracking, geometric data analysis, and other areas where data may be curve-like or line-based instead of discrete points.
