That's an exciting development! Harvey partnering with OpenAI to build a custom-trained model for legal professionals suggests a focus on creating AI tools specifically tailored to the legal industry's needs. This could include capabilities such as:

- Automating document review and contract analysis
- Assisting with legal research by quickly summarizing case law and statutes
- Drafting legal documents and briefs with accuracy
- Enhancing due diligence processes
- Providing insights to improve decision-making and reduce human error

If you want, I can provide more details on how AI is impacting the legal sector or how such custom-trained models typically work. Would you like me to do that?
