That sounds like a fascinating initiative! By surveying over 1,000 people worldwide on their expectations for AI behavior, OpenAI is gathering valuable insights to ensure AI systems align better with diverse human values and cultural perspectives. Comparing these collective viewpoints with the existing Model Spec helps identify areas where AI defaults might be improved or adjusted, fostering more ethical, respectful, and useful AI interactions for everyone.

If you're interested, I can help summarize key findings, explain what the Model Spec entails, or discuss how collective alignment influences AI development. Just let me know!
