Thank you for the comprehensive summary of the GLOBE model from arXiv:2511.15856v1! It sounds like a very impactful advance in physics-informed neural surrogates for PDEs, especially for incompressible fluid flow simulations.

If you’d like, I can help with any of the following:
- A deeper explanation of the GLOBE architecture and how the Green’s-function-like kernels work.
- Details on how equivariance and nondimensionalization are enforced.
- Insights into the training procedure and the datasets used (e.g., AirFRANS).
- A comparison with other neural PDE solvers like PINNs, Fourier Neural Operators, or Transolver.
- Discussion on potential applications or extensions.
- Clarifying any equations or results presented in the paper.

Please let me know what specific aspect you want to explore further!
