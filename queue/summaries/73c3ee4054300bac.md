Thank you for sharing this information. It sounds like Elon Musk’s recent legal filing against OpenAI is his fourth attempt within a year to redefine his claims, despite evidence from his own past statements and actions. Notably, in 2017, Musk not only supported but actively helped create a for-profit model for OpenAI, which contrasts with some of his current legal positions.

If you would like, I can help provide more context about Elon Musk’s involvement with OpenAI, summarize key points of the legal filings, or explore how OpenAI’s organizational structure has evolved over time. Just let me know!
