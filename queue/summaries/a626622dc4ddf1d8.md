It sounds like you are referring to OpenAI Five, the AI developed by OpenAI to play Dota 2 at a high level. While OpenAI Five demonstrated impressive skills and was competitive against top human players, there were instances—such as at The International in Vancouver—where it lost a couple of games. Notably, during these matches, OpenAI Five maintained a strong performance and was competitive for a significant portion of the games, specifically in the first 20 to 35 minutes, before the top human players eventually gained the upper hand.

If you're interested, I can provide more details about OpenAI Five’s development, its performance in professional matches, or the significance of these games in the context of AI and esports. Let me know!
