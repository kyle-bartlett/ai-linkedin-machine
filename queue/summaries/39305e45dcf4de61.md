That sounds like an exciting development! OpenAI’s new research shedding light on why language models hallucinate is a significant step forward. Understanding the root causes of hallucinations — where models generate incorrect or fabricated information — helps in designing better evaluation methods. Improved evaluations can, in turn, guide model training and fine-tuning processes to make AI outputs more reliable, truthful, and safe for users. 

If you’re interested, I can provide a summary of the key insights from the research or explain how these improved evaluations work and their implications for AI deployment. Let me know!
