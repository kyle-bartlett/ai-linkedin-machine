As of now, ChatGPT has been enhanced to improve data analysis capabilities by allowing users to:

- **Interact with tables and charts**: You can now input tabular data or charts directly, and ChatGPT can help analyze, interpret, and summarize the information effectively.

- **Add files directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive**: You can upload files stored in your cloud storage accounts seamlessly, making it easier to share datasets, spreadsheets, presentations, or other relevant documents for analysis.

These improvements make it more convenient to work with complex data within ChatGPT, enabling richer, more interactive conversations around your data insights. If you'd like, I can guide you on how to use these features or help analyze specific tables or charts you have.
