Great! Your statement highlights an important advancement in robotics: moving from open-loop to closed-loop control systems by leveraging simulation-trained controllers that can adapt to real-world conditions.

If you’d like, I can help you elaborate on this concept, explain the significance, or assist with a technical write-up. For example, you might want to discuss:

- **What is an open-loop vs. closed-loop system?** Explaining that open-loop systems follow a fixed sequence of commands without feedback, whereas closed-loop systems use sensor feedback to adapt their actions dynamically.
- **Benefits of closed-loop controllers trained in simulation:** Such as improved robustness, adaptability to unforeseen changes, and reduced need for manual tuning on physical robots.
- **Challenges in transferring from simulation to reality (sim-to-real gap):** And how your techniques help overcome them.

Would you like me to help draft a more detailed explanation or presentation text based on your summary?
