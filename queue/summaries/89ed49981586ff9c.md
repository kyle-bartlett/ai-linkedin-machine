That sounds like a fascinating project! Creating a neural theorem prover for Lean capable of tackling challenging high-school olympiad problems such as AMC12, AIME, and IMO-level questions is a significant achievement. If you’d like, I can help with:

- Discussing approaches to designing neural theorem provers in Lean.
- Suggestions on integrating machine learning models with Lean’s theorem proving environment.
- Tips for handling complex problem encodings and guiding proof search.
- Insights on evaluation metrics for theorem proving performance on these competitions.
- Or any other details you'd like to explore or share about your project!

Feel free to provide more details or ask specific questions.
