The paper (arXiv:2511.15986v1) addresses the challenge of fairness in medical image reasoning using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Key points include:

- **Problem**: While MLLMs are promising for medical image reasoning, they often exhibit unfair performance disparities across demographic groups (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity). Existing debiasing methods either need large labeled datasets or require fine-tuning, which is impractical for large foundation models.

- **Approach**: The authors investigate **In-Context Learning (ICL)** as a lightweight alternative that does not require model tuning.

- **Findings**: Traditional demonstration selection (DS) methods in ICL tend to reinforce demographic imbalances because the chosen exemplar sets are demographically biased.

- **Proposed Method**: They introduce **Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS)**, which uses clustering-based sampling to create demonstration sets that are both **demographically balanced** and **semantically relevant**.

- **Results**: Experiments on various medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS:
  - Reduces disparities tied to gender, race, and ethnicity,
  - Maintains strong overall accuracy,
  - Offers a scalable and efficient solution by enabling fairer medical image reasoning without expensive data or retraining.

- **Contribution**: This work highlights the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a practical means to achieve equitable performance in multimodal medical AI applications.
