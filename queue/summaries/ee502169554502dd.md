That sounds great! Embeddings are powerful for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. If you'd like, I can help you understand how to use the new embeddings endpoint in the OpenAI API, including example code snippets or explanations about how embeddings work for tasks like semantic search, clustering, topic modeling, and classification. Let me know what you need!
