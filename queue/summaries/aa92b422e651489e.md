The paper with arXiv ID 2511.16225v1 presents a new approach for real-time inference in connected cyber-physical systems that deal with multiple data streams experiencing uncertain communication delays. Here's a summary of the key points:

- **Problem Addressed:**  
  Current state-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference systems rely heavily on a "reference-modality" approach. This means one stream (modality) must be fully received before inference begins, which can be inefficient and depends on costly offline profiling. These methods struggle with communication delays and temporal alignment, impacting real-time performance.

- **Proposed Solution:**  
  The authors introduce a *neuro-inspired* non-blocking inference paradigm using *adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs)*. This method dynamically adjusts the temporal integration window depending on the stochastic communication delays of heterogeneous data streams. As a result, it relaxes the need to wait for a full reference modality input.

- **Key Contributions:**  
  1. An adaptive TWI mechanism allowing flexible integration of asynchronous data.  
  2. A communication-delay-aware framework that balances inference accuracy and latency effectively in real time.  
  3. Reduced dependence on prior offline profiling to characterize delay patterns.

- **Experimental Validation:**  
  They tested their framework on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task, which involves detecting events by fusing asynchronous audio and visual inputs. Their approach demonstrated superior adaptability and robustness to varying network conditions compared to existing SotA methods.

This work is relevant for cyber-physical systems, robotics, multimedia processing, and any applications requiring robust multi-sensor fusion under uncertain communication delays.
