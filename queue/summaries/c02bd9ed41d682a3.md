That's correct! OpenAI's models like **o3** and **o4-mini** offer powerful reasoning abilities combined with extensive tool integrations, including:

- **Web browsing** for up-to-date information retrieval.
- **Python execution** for calculations, data analysis, and scripting.
- **Image and file analysis** to interpret visual or document-based inputs.
- **Image generation** to create visuals based on prompts.
- **Canvas** for interactive drawing or visual tasks.
- **Automations** to streamline workflows.
- **File search** to locate and reference specific documents.
- **Memory** for retaining context across interactions.

These combined capabilities allow the models to perform complex tasks that go beyond simple text generation, making them versatile assistants in various domains. If you'd like, I can help demonstrate or explain any specific feature!
