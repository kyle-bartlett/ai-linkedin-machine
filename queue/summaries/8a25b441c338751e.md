I'm glad you like the outline! I can certainly help draft specific sections or provide example prompts tailored for classroom use. Which part would you like me to start with? For example, I could draft the full "Understanding ChatGPT’s Limitations" section or create a list of ready-to-use prompts for students. Just let me know!
