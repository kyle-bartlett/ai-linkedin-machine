The paper **arXiv:2511.16145v1** presents a new perspective on **Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD)** by emphasizing the value of limited labeled data over complex model architectures.

### Key Points:
- **Problem background:**  
  Time series anomaly detection is important but often lacks labeled anomaly data, so most prior work focuses on unsupervised methods that model normal data distributions using complex architectures.

- **Main insight:**  
  Limited anomaly labels — which are often available in practice — can provide significant performance improvements, yet have been under-explored.

- **Contributions:**  
  1. **First systematic comparison** between supervised and unsupervised time series anomaly detection methods under limited labeling budgets.  
  2. Introduction of **STAND**, a simple supervised baseline model for TSAD that leverages limited labeled anomalies.  
  3. Extensive experiments on five public datasets showing:  
     - **Labels matter more than model complexity**: simple supervised models outperform complex unsupervised methods when given even a few labels.  
     - **Supervision yields higher returns** than architectural innovations alone.  
     - **Practical benefits** of STAND include more consistent predictions and better anomaly localization.  

- **Implications:**  
  The study advocates a **data-centric approach** to TSAD, encouraging research focus on effective use of available labels rather than developing increasingly complex unsupervised architectures.

- **Code availability:**  
  The STAND codebase is publicly available:
