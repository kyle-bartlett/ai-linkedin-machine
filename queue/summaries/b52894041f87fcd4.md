The paper titled in arXiv:2511.10848v2 presents a novel method for adapting general time series foundation models (TSFMs) to EEG-specific tasks. Key points include:

- **Context:**  
  *Time series foundation models* pretrained on diverse domains have achieved strong results across varied tasks. Meanwhile, several foundation models tailored specifically for EEG data (termed EEG-specific foundation models or EEGFMs) exist. However, no prior work has directly compared these EEGFMs to general TSFMs on EEG-specific tasks.

- **Contribution:**  
  The authors propose **STAMP (Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling)**, a lightweight adapter module that can be plugged into general TSFMs. STAMP:
  - Uses univariate embeddings from a general TSFM as input.
  - Implicitly models spatial and temporal characteristics of EEG data.
  - Achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEG foundation models.
  - Supports flexible input types and has fewer trainable parameters, making it lightweight and adaptable.

- **Experiments:**  
  Extensive evaluations are conducted on 8 clinical benchmark EEG datasets focused on classification tasks. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed adapter.

- **Significance:**  
  This work bridges the gap between general time series models and EEG-specific models by enabling general TSFMs to efficiently handle EEG data without extensive retraining or model redesign. It offers a flexible, parameter-efficient approach for leveraging pretrained TSFMs in EEG analysis.
