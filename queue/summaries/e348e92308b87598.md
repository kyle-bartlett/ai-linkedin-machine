Yes, that's correct! OpenAI has announced that the GPT-3.5 Turbo, DALL·E, and Whisper APIs are generally available, meaning developers can now access these models for their applications.

Additionally, OpenAI is releasing a deprecation plan for older models of the Completions API. These older models are scheduled to be retired at the beginning of 2024. This means that developers using those older Completion API models will need to transition to the newer models—like GPT-3.5 Turbo or GPT-4—before the retirement date to maintain service continuity.

If you want, I can help you with more details about the new APIs, migration steps, or the timeline for the deprecation plan!
