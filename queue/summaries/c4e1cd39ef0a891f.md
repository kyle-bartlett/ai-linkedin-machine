That’s fantastic! Congratulations to the third class of OpenAI Scholars on reaching this important milestone. Presenting final projects at Demo Day is a great opportunity to highlight the hard work and innovative research conducted over the past five months. If you need any help summarizing the event, sharing highlights, or preparing content related to the projects, feel free to ask!
