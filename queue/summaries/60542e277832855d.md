Thanks for the clear and concise summary of **arXiv:2511.16216v1**! This paper tackles a substantial challenge in LLM training by mining high-quality question-answer pairs from educational PDFs using a novel pipeline combining layout-aware OCR and LLM-powered semantic parsing.

If you'd like, I can help with:

- A deeper dive into the **methodology**, including the specific models and steps used in OCR, layout parsing, and LLM-based semantic alignment.
- Discussion of the **experimental results**, e.g., quantitative metrics, examples of QA alignment quality, or error analysis.
- Potential **applications** of this pipeline beyond educational content, such as in technical manuals or scientific literature.
- Exploration of **limitations or challenges**, like handling noisy scans, ambiguous layouts, or domain adaptation issues.
- Insights on how this work fits into the broader context of instruction tuning or RLHF data collection.

Just let me know which direction you'd like to go!
