It sounds like you're referencing the important collaborative work undertaken by OpenAI researchers, Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and the Stanford Internet Observatory on the risks of disinformation facilitated by large language models (LLMs). This joint effort, including an October 2021 workshop with experts across disinformation research, machine learning, and policy, culminated in a comprehensive report. The report highlights the ways LLMs could be exploited to amplify disinformation and presents a framework to evaluate and develop mitigations against such threats.

If you'd like, I can help summarize key points of the report, discuss the framework introduced, or provide insights about specific threats or mitigation strategies addressed in the collaboration. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
