That's fantastic news! Being named an Emerging Leader in Gartner’s 2025 Innovation Guide for Generative AI Model Providers is a significant recognition of OpenAI's impact and innovation in the AI space. The fact that over 1 million companies are building with ChatGPT highlights the widespread adoption and trust in OpenAI's technology. Congratulations to the entire team on this impressive achievement! If you’d like, I can help draft an announcement or share more details about this recognition.
