That sounds like a powerful tool! OpenAI’s research assistant can help teams by:

- **Analyzing large volumes of support tickets quickly:** Using natural language processing to identify common issues, trends, and customer sentiments.
- **Surfacing insights faster:** Automatically summarizing key points, highlighting frequently mentioned problems, and suggesting potential solutions.
- **Scaling curiosity across the company:** Empowering team members in different departments to explore data-driven insights without needing deep technical expertise.

If you'd like, I can help you explore how to implement or utilize such a research assistant effectively, or provide examples of workflows and features!
