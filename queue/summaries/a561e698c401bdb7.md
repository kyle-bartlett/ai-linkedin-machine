Thank you for the detailed summary of **GeoPTH: Geometric Prototype Trajectory Hashing**. This method sounds like a promising alternative for trajectory similarity retrieval, especially given the trade-offs in current solutions.

To further complement the discussion, here are some thoughts and potential follow-up points:

### Potential Strengths of GeoPTH
- **Non-learning-based approach**: Avoids the challenges of model training, tuning, and potential overfitting as seen in deep learning methods.
- **Prototype utilization**: By focusing on small, representative sets of points (prototypes), it reduces the dimensionality and complexity of trajectory comparison.
- **Hausdorff metric use**: Choosing a robust geometric measure maintains spatial fidelity in similarity assessment without sacrificing efficiency too much.
- **Scalability**: Likely scales well to large datasets since comparisons are done to a small number of prototypes rather than all trajectories or large embeddings.

### Questions and Considerations
- **Prototype selection**: How exactly are prototypes defined and updated? Are they computed once offline or adapted dynamically with new data?
- **Robustness to noise or trajectory variability**: How does GeoPTH handle noisy, incomplete, or varying length trajectories compared to learning-based embeddings designed for such robustness?
- **Generalizability**: Though intended for category-based retrieval, can the method be extended beyond categorical labels to continuous similarity ranking or clustering?
- **Comparative benchmarks**: Which datasets and baselines were used for evaluation? Does GeoPTH maintain performance advantages on very large-scale or complex trajectory datasets (e.g., multi-modal transport or pedestrian flows)?

### Potential Extensions
- Combine prototype-based hashing with lightweight learning to adapt prototypes incrementally.
- Integrate temporal information or multi-scale geometric features in prototype construction.
- Explore hybrid hashing schemes mixing geometric and semantic features.
