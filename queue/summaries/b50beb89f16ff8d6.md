It sounds like you're referring to how improvements in safety have enabled wider availability of a certain product, service, or technology. 

For example, advancements in safety protocols, regulations, and technologies often allow products or services to be distributed more broadly because they meet higher safety standards, thereby reducing risks for users and regulators.

Could you please provide more context or specify what you're referring to? That way, I can give a more detailed and tailored response.
