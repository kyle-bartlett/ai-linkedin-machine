Here’s a quick overview of the latest updates you mentioned:

1. **GPT-4 Turbo with 128K Context and Lower Prices**  
   - **128K context window** means GPT-4 Turbo can now handle up to 128,000 tokens in a single prompt, enabling much longer conversations, documents, or interactions without losing context.  
   - **Lower prices** make it more affordable to use powerful GPT-4 capabilities at scale.

2. **New Assistants API**  
   - This API allows developers to create and customize AI assistants tailored to specific tasks, workflows, or personalities. It’s designed to make integrating and fine-tuning assistants easier for various applications.

3. **GPT-4 Turbo with Vision**  
   - GPT-4 Turbo now supports multimodal inputs, meaning it can understand and generate responses based on images in addition to text. This is useful for tasks like image description, analysis, or generating content related to visual inputs.

4. **DALL·E 3 API**  
   - The latest DALL·E 3 model is available via API, allowing developers to generate high-quality images from text prompts programmatically. It offers improved image fidelity, understanding, and creative control.
