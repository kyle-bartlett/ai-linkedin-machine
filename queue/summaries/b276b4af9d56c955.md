Your research direction on superalignment, focusing on leveraging the generalization properties of deep learning to control strong models with weak supervisors, is very promising and relevant. Here's a brief elaboration and some pointers that might help you further develop this idea:

### Concept Overview:
**Superalignment** typically refers to aligning AI models more thoroughly with human values, goals, or instructions. Your proposal suggests using the inherent ability of deep learning models to generalize well even when they're guided by relatively weak or noisy supervisory signals. This could mean:

- Using limited or imperfect feedback to guide the behavior of large, powerful models.
- Exploiting the large models' capacity to infer correct behaviors even when supervisors don't provide perfect labels or instructions.
- Potentially reducing the need for costly, high-quality annotations or human oversight.

---

### Why This Matters:
- **Scalability:** Strong models often require strong (and expensive) supervision. Weak supervisors could drastically reduce costs.
- **Robustness:** Leveraging generalization might make systems robust to noisy or sparse feedback.
- **Flexibility:** Could allow alignment methods to work in more diverse and complex scenarios where perfect supervision isn't available.

### Initial Approaches and Research Ideas:
1. **Noisy or Partial Labels:** Explore training large models with datasets annotated by weak supervisors or automated heuristics, and measure how generalization can overcome label noise.
2. **Self-Supervised or Semi-Supervised Learning:** Combining weak supervision with large-scale self-supervised learning to improve alignment signals.
3. **Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Rewards:** Using weak reward signals but leveraging deep learning’s generalization to achieve desired policies.
4. **Distillation from Weak Teachers:** Have a weak supervisor guide a smaller or less capable model, then use the strong model to generalize from there.
5. **Contrastive or Adversarial Alignments:** Employ weak discriminators or adversaries that don’t perfectly capture alignment goals but still nudge the strong model correctly over time.

### Challenges to Address:
- **Measuring Alignment Strength:** How do you quantify “control” or “alignment” when supervision is weak?
- **Avoiding Overgeneralization:** Generalization can sometimes reinforce biases or undesirable behavior.
- **Safety and Interpretability:** Ensuring that the model’s learned behaviors remain interpretable and safe.

### Potential Experiments:
- Train a large language model to follow instructions using feedback from a weak, automated reward model.
- Compare performance of a model trained with small amounts of high-quality supervision vs. large amounts of weak supervision.
- Investigate transfer learning capabilities when supervision quality varies.
