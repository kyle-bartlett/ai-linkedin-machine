It looks like you're asking for information about the "OpenAI o1 system card," specifically regarding external testers and acknowledgements.

As of now, OpenAI’s system cards (such as those in the OpenAI open-source or public documentation spaces) typically include details on model capabilities, limitations, safety measures, and sometimes acknowledgements of contributors or testers.

If you're referring to an official "o1 system card"—for example, related to the code-named “o1” model or system—OpenAI has sometimes included acknowledgements sections that thank external researchers, testers, or contributors who helped evaluate or improve the system.

Since there isn't a publicly shared official “o1 system card” available in OpenAI’s main released documentation or blog posts, there's no publicly known list of external testers or a formal acknowledgements section specific to it.

If you are working on or requesting content related to such a system card, typical acknowledgements might look like:

---

**External Testers and Acknowledgements**

We thank the external testers and collaborators who contributed to the evaluation and improvement of the o1 system, including domain experts, research partners, and members of the broader AI community. Their feedback was invaluable in identifying model limitations and ensuring safety standards.

If you want me to draft a more formal acknowledgements section or find specific details related to an internal or external document, please share more context or clarify your needs!
