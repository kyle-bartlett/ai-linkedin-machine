That sounds like an exciting development! Deliberative alignment, where language models are explicitly taught both safety specifications and how to reason about them, can significantly improve model reliability and safety. By enabling models to engage in reasoning over safety constraints, they can better handle ambiguous or complex situations that require nuanced understanding.

If you’d like, I can help you draft a more detailed explanation or announcement about this new alignment strategy for your o1 models, or assist with outlining key benefits and potential applications. Just let me know!
