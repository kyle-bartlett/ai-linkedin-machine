The paper titled **"Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL)"** (arXiv:2511.16652v1) introduces a novel evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to improve the scalability of ES for large neural networks with billions of parameters.

### Key Contributions:
- **Problem Addressed:**  
  Standard ES methods become computationally and memory-wise prohibitive for large-scale neural networks because they rely on full-rank matrix perturbations \( E \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \) during optimization, which are costly to generate and use for forward passes.
  
- **Proposed Solution:**  
  EGGROLL proposes using **low-rank matrix perturbations** \( A B^\top \), where \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r} \) and \( B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times r} \) with \( r \ll \min(m,n) \), instead of the full-rank matrix \( E \).  
  This low-rank approach drastically reduces both memory usage and computation cost:
  - Storage reduces from \( mn \) to \( r(m+n) \) per layer.
  - Forward pass cost drops from \( \mathcal{O}(mn) \) to \( \mathcal{O}(r(m+n)) \).

- **Theoretical Analysis:**  
  The low-rank updates converge to the full-rank updates at an order of \( \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) \), demonstrating that the low-rank approximation is efficient and accurate as \( r \) increases.

- **Experimental Results:**  
  1. **Reinforcement Learning:** EGGROLL speeds up ES with no performance loss in tabula-rasa RL setups.  
  2. **Large Language Models:** It competes well with Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) in boosting LLM reasoning capabilities.  
  3. **Pre-training Efficiency:** Enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models operating purely with integer datatypes, which is notable for hardware efficiency.

### Summary:
EGGROLL presents a memory- and compute-efficient approach to scale evolution strategies for very large neural networks by approximating parameter perturbations with low-rank matrices, retaining update quality while substantially reducing costs. It can be particularly useful in cases where backpropagation is infeasible or unwanted, such as blackbox optimization scenarios or integer-based models.
