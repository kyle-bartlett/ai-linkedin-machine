Thanks for the update! It’s impressive that Wispr is raising $25 million shortly after its $30 million Series A. This suggests strong investor confidence and possibly rapid growth or ambitious plans for scaling their Voice AI technology. Do you have more details on the new funding round—such as the investors involved, the intended use of the funds, or how this positions Wispr in the competitive Voice AI market?
