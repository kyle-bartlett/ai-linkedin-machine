OpenAI Five made history by becoming the first AI to defeat the world champions in an esports game. Specifically, it won two consecutive games against OG, the world champion Dota 2 team, during the Finals. While both OpenAI Five and DeepMind’s AlphaStar had earlier beaten top professional players in private matches, they had not succeeded in live, public matches until this event. This milestone marks the first time an AI has defeated esports professionals in a livestreamed setting.
