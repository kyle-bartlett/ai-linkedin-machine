As of my latest update in June 2024, there has been no official announcement regarding a partnership between OpenAI and Apple to integrate ChatGPT into Apple experiences. If such news has recently emerged, it would represent a significant development in AI integration within Apple's ecosystem.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking official sources such as Apple's newsroom or OpenAI's blog. If you have any specific questions or need more details about potential integrations or how ChatGPT could be used within Apple products, feel free to ask!
