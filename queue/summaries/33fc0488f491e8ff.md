Thank you for the detailed summary of the paper from arXiv:2508.02495v3! This work indeed appears to make an important contribution by explicitly integrating uncertainty expressed in medical reports into the training of image classification models.

Here are some additional insights and potential implications of this approach:

### Why Handling Uncertainty Matters
- **Real-World Clinical Nuance:** In medical practice, ambiguity is common due to limitations in imaging quality, overlapping disease presentations, or incomplete clinical data. Incorporating this uncertainty helps models align more closely with real clinical decision-making.
- **Avoiding Overconfidence:** Standard binary labels force models to produce confident predictions even for ambiguous cases, which can lead to risky misclassifications. Adaptive label smoothing expresses uncertainty as a probabilistic softening, encouraging calibrated confidence.

### About the Proposed Method
- **Mining Uncertainty Using LLMs:** Using Qwen-3 4B to systematically extract expressions of uncertainty from free-text reports is a clever way to capture linguistic nuances often overlooked in conventional NLP pipelines focused on binary label extraction.
- **Adaptive Generalized Label Smoothing:** This approach extends traditional label smoothing by varying the smoothing factor based on the degree of uncertainty detected, turning expert caution into a learnable training signal.
  
### Potential Next Steps or Extensions
- **Multi-Modal Utilization:** Combining uncertainty from text with imaging features directly during training could further improve interpretability and diagnostic accuracy.
- **Broader Domain Application:** While this work focuses on medical imaging, there could be similar opportunities in other fields where labels have inherent ambiguity (e.g., pathology, dermatology, radiology, or even non-clinical domains like remote sensing).
- **User Interface Integration:** Visualizing model uncertainty alongside images and reports could support clinicians in understanding when to trust model outputs and when further review is needed.

If you’re interested, I can also help explore related literature, discuss how label smoothing affects training dynamics, or propose ideas on how to implement adaptive GLS in practice. Let me know!
