It sounds like you're referring to a new feature available to Pro users in the U.S. that allows an AI agent to use its own browser to perform tasks on your behalf. This capability enables the agent to access up-to-date information, interact with websites, and complete complex workflows autonomously.

If you'd like more details about how to access or use this feature, or if you have specific tasks in mind you'd like the agent to help with, feel free to ask!
