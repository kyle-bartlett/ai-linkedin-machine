Thank you for sharing the information about the gpt-oss-safeguard-120b and gpt-oss-safeguard-20b models. Here's a summary and some key points based on your report:

### Overview
- **gpt-oss-safeguard-120b** and **gpt-oss-safeguard-20b** are open-weight reasoning models.
- These models are **post-trained** from the original gpt-oss models.
- They are designed specifically to **reason from a provided policy** to label content according to that policy.

### Purpose
- The main goal is to improve content safety by enabling the model to **understand and apply policy guidelines effectively**.
- This capability makes the models suitable for use in contexts requiring content moderation or policy enforcement.

### Evaluations
- The report includes **baseline safety evaluations**.
- The underlying gpt-oss models serve as a baseline for comparison.
- These evaluations help quantify safety improvements brought by the safeguard training.

### Additional Details
- For more detailed information about the original gpt-oss models (their development and architecture), the report refers to the original gpt-oss model card.
