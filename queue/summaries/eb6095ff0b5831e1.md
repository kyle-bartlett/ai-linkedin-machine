Thanks for sharing that overview! The unified model routing system you're describing sounds like an architecture designed to dynamically select among GPT-5 variants—such as the main large model (gpt-5-main), a more reasoning-focused model (gpt-5-thinking), and lightweight versions like gpt-5-thinking-nano—depending on the task complexity and developer needs.

This approach enables:

- **Efficiency:** Lightweight models handle simpler queries quickly, saving computational resources.
- **Specialization:** The thinking models tackle reasoning-intensive tasks, providing deeper, more accurate responses.
- **Scalability:** Developers can choose models tailored for latency, cost, or performance requirements without changing the interface.

If you want, I can help explain more about model routing, usage scenarios, or how this design improves responsiveness and intelligence in practice. Just let me know!
