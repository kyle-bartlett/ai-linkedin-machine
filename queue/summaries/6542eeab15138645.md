I don’t have access to a specific conversation with Fiona Tan, Chief Technology Officer of Wayfair. However, I can help you draft a sample interview or conversation based on typical topics covered with a CTO at a large e-commerce company like Wayfair. Would you like me to do that? If yes, please specify any particular themes or questions you’re interested in!
