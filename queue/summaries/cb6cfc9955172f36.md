The paper titled "arXiv:2510.02119v2" addresses the estimation of the inverse covariance matrix (precision matrix) in high-dimensional settings. The authors focus on two estimator classes:

1. **Linear shrinkage estimators**, where the shrinkage target is proportional to the identity matrix.
2. **Estimators derived from data augmentation (DA)**, where the dataset is enriched with artificial samples generated by generative models or random transformations before fitting the model.

Key contributions and findings include:

- Derivation of estimators and concentration bounds on their quadratic error, facilitating method comparison and hyperparameter tuning (e.g., how many artificial samples to add).
- Introduction of a novel deterministic equivalent for generalized resolvent matrices, extending random matrix theory tools to handle dependent samples with specific structures (which arise in DA).
- Numerical experiments supporting the theoretical results.

Overall, the work provides a rigorous theoretical analysis complemented by practical insights on how to optimally use data augmentation for inverse covariance estimation in high dimensions.
