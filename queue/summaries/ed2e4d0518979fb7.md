The paper "Misleading Fine-Tuning (MisFT): A Novel Approach to Examine Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models" (arXiv:2503.16401v2) investigates whether large language models (LLMs) go beyond memorization to perform true abstract and rule-based reasoning.

**Key points from the abstract:**

- **Motivation:** While LLMs have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, it remains unclear if they truly grasp abstract rules or simply memorize patterns.

- **Approach:** The authors introduce *Misleading Fine-Tuning (MisFT)*, a method where LLMs are fine-tuned on specially designed datasets containing mathematical or logical expressions that deliberately contradict correct principles.

- **Purpose:** By teaching models these "incorrect" rules, the study evaluates if LLMs adopt and apply these contradictory principles to new, unseen problem domains.

- **Findings:** Experiments suggest that current LLMs do internalize and apply the contradictory rules learned during MisFT when solving mathematical word problems and natural language reasoning tasks.

- **Implication:** This indicates that LLMs may possess an internal abstraction mechanism that enables reasoning beyond mere memorization or surface pattern matching.
