The paper with arXiv ID **2511.16090v1** introduces advances in deterministic policy gradient algorithms used for continuous control tasks in reinforcement learning. Here's a summary of the key points from the abstract:

- **Problem Addressed:**  
  Deterministic policy gradient methods tend to suffer from value estimation biases, which hurt their performance. Specifically, overestimation and underestimation of value functions can degrade learning quality.

- **Prior Work:**  
  Double critics are known to reduce value estimation bias (commonly overestimation). However, using double actors to improve exploration potential has not been sufficiently studied.

- **Main Contribution:**  
  The paper builds on a previously proposed temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR) double actor-critic framework and proposes enhanced techniques:
  1. **Three convex combination strategies (symmetric and asymmetric):**  
     These strategies blend pessimistic (to reduce overestimation) and optimistic (to encourage exploration and reduce underestimation) estimates through the use of double actors.  
  2. **Single hyperparameter:**  
     Controls the convex combination to finely tune bias levels between overestimation and underestimation during training.

- **Additional Improvements:**  
  They augment the state and action representations within the actor and critic networks for stronger representation learning.

- **Results:**  
  - Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method consistently outperforms existing benchmarks.  
  - The findings highlight that both over- and underestimation biases can be useful in different ways depending on the environment, and tunable bias control helps exploit this.

### In short:
The paper proposes a novel way to manage value estimation biases in deterministic policy gradients by combining double actors and double critics with flexible bias control via convex combinations, governed by a single tunable hyperparameter, and enhanced network input representations. This results in improved continuous control performance across different environments.
