The paper titled "Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio (ExCIR)" (arXiv:2511.16482v1) proposes a new approach to global feature attribution tailored for Explainable AI (XAI), especially in complex, high-stakes applications requiring transparent and trustworthy model explanations. Here's a brief overview of the key contributions:

### Key contributions:
1. **ExCIR (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio)**:
   - A correlation-aware global attribution score.
   - Measures sign-aligned co-movement between input features and model outputs after applying *robust centering* (e.g., subtracting medians or mid-means).
   - Designed to be computationally efficient by enabling explanations from only a fraction of the dataset rather than requiring the full data.

2. **BlockCIR (Groupwise extension of ExCIR)**:
   - Groups correlated features and scores them collectively to avoid double-counting effects common with collinear or redundant features.
   - Helps stabilize and smooth feature importance rankings when strong feature dependencies exist (like synonyms or duplicated sensors).

3. **Performance highlights**:
   - Demonstrated good alignment and agreement with established global explanation baselines across various data types: text, tabular data, signals, and images.
   - Maintains consistency in identifying top-k important features.
   - Offers significant runtime improvements by requiring only a subset of data for explanatory computations.

### Practical significance:
ExCIR and its extension BlockCIR provide a **scalable**, **efficient**, and **robust** way to perform global feature attribution in challenging real-world settings, especially when features are correlated or datasets are large and heterogeneous. This method addresses common problems such as computational cost and instability in explanations due to multicollinearity.
