Thank you for the detailed summary! This sounds like a very promising study with important clinical implications. If you’d like, I can help with:

- Summarizing or elaborating on specific sections (e.g., methods, results, or limitations)  
- Discussing the potential impact and application of this approach  
- Explaining the machine learning techniques used, including tree-based models and Shapley value analysis  
- Exploring how ECG features correlate with neoplasm-related cardiovascular changes  
- Comparing this approach with other diagnostic modalities for neoplasms  

Just let me know how you’d like to proceed!
