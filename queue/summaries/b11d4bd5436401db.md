It looks like ChatGPT will no longer be available on WhatsApp after January 15, 2026. To keep using ChatGPT and maintain access to your conversations, you can link your ChatGPT account and continue chatting across different devices.

Here’s how you can do that:

1. **Create or Log In to Your ChatGPT Account**  
   Visit the official ChatGPT website or app and sign up for a new account or log in to your existing one.

2. **Link Your Account (If Coming from WhatsApp)**  
   If you previously used ChatGPT on WhatsApp, look for an option in the WhatsApp chatbot messages or settings to link your WhatsApp usage to your ChatGPT account. This may involve clicking a link or entering a code.

3. **Access Your Conversations Across Devices**  
   Once your account is linked, you can log in to ChatGPT on any supported device — web browsers, mobile apps, tablets, etc. Your chat history and preferences will sync across devices for seamless continuity.

4. **Back Up Important Conversations**  
   Consider exporting or saving any important conversations before the January 15, 2026 cutoff date to avoid losing any data.

If you need detailed instructions or support, check the official OpenAI or ChatGPT help pages, as they will have the most current and specific guidance.
