Thank you for the detailed summary! If you’d like, I can help with the following:

- A deeper dive into the **GNN architecture** used in the paper (e.g., type of GNN, input features, output targets).
- Details on the **dynamic graph modeling** and how quantum-specific characteristics are encoded.
- Explanation of the **training methodology** and datasets used for the experiments.
- Discussion of the **optimization objectives** (loss functions, constraints).
- Insights on the **scalability and generalizability** aspects.
- Comparison with existing QKD optimization methods.
- Any other specific section or detail you want from the paper.

Let me know how you want to proceed!
