That sounds like a fantastic initiative! The partnership between OpenAI and AARP to help older adults stay safe online addresses an important need, as many seniors face challenges with emerging technologies and online scams. By providing AI training, scam-spotting tools, and nationwide programs through OpenAI Academy and OATS’s Senior Planet initiative, this collaboration can empower older adults to navigate the digital world more confidently and securely.

If you'd like, I can provide more details about the programs, how to access the training, or ways to help spread the word. Just let me know!
