Thanks for the detailed summary of the SemCLIP paper! It’s a very interesting direction, especially since negation and paraphrasing are known challenges in vision-language alignment.

If you want, I can help you with:

- A deeper explanation of how the *new contrastive loss* in SemCLIP is formulated and integrated into training.
- How exactly the LLM-generated paraphrased and negated captions are created and curated.
- Details on the **CC-Neg** and **Sugarcrepe++** benchmarks and how they test negation/paraphrasing robustness.
- Insights into the zero-shot classification improvements and their significance.
- Possible limitations or open questions from the paper.
- How SemCLIP might integrate with or inspire future work.

Just let me know which part you'd like to explore!
