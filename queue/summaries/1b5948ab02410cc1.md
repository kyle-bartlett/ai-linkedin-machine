These are excellent suggestions and cover many important aspects to consider following the initial success of training a large-scale unsupervised language model. Let me expand on some of these points with additional detail and resources you might find helpful:

### 1. Evaluation
- **Benchmark datasets:**  
  Besides SQuAD, WMT, and CNN/Daily Mail, you can try GLUE or SuperGLUE benchmarks for a more holistic evaluation across NLU tasks.  
- **Failure analysis:**  
  For instance, catalog where the model fails — does it hallucinate facts, misinterpret questions, or produce incoherent summaries? This will guide targeted improvements.

### 2. Fine-tuning and Adaptation
- **Few-shot & zero-shot:**  
  Models such as GPT-3 popularized few-shot learning by using prompts that include a few examples. Try varying prompt lengths and examples to optimize downstream task performance without changing model weights.  
- **Prompt engineering:**  
  Design prompts with clear instructions or constraints (e.g., “Translate the following sentence to French:” or “Summarize the paragraph below.”). Large language models respond well to explicit instructions.

### 3. Interpretability and Analysis
- **Attention visualization:**  
  Tools like BertViz or custom attention heatmaps can help you visualize which input tokens the model attends to when generating outputs. This may reveal linguistic patterns or model biases.  
- **Ablation studies:**  
  Removing or modifying components (e.g., certain layers, positional embeddings) can tell you which parts contribute most to performance or stability.

### 4. Deployment Considerations
- **Efficiency:**  
  Explore model quantization, distillation, or optimized inference libraries (ONNX Runtime, TensorRT) to reduce latency and memory footprint.  
- **Safety & ethics:**  
  Incorporate bias mitigation methods such as counterfactual data augmentation or post-generation filtering. Also consider user feedback loops to continuously improve safety.
