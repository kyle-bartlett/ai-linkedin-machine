Iterated amplification is an intriguing approach to AI safety that focuses on breaking down complex tasks into simpler components, guided by human understanding rather than relying solely on traditional training signals like labeled data or explicit reward functions. By iteratively decomposing a challenging task into manageable sub-tasks and training AI to handle these simpler pieces, the overall system can learn to perform sophisticated behaviors that might be difficult to specify directly.

This method aligns with the broader goal of ensuring AI systems remain aligned with human values and intentions, especially as the tasks they undertake surpass what any individual human can fully comprehend or label. Early experiments in controlled, toy algorithmic environments provide preliminary evidence that iterated amplification can effectively teach models complex behavior by leveraging this decomposition strategy.

While still in the early stages, iterated amplification holds promise as a scalable AI safety technique by shifting the design challenge away from fully specifying reward functions or gathering extensive labeled datasets—instead relying on a more interpretable, step-by-step human-guided teaching process. Further research, particularly in more realistic and complex domains, will be critical to validate and refine this approach.
