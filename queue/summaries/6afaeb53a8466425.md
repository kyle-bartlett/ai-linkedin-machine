Thanks for the summary! This sounds like a very useful package for working with Gaussian mixtures, especially when exact continuous representations are computationally heavy or infeasible. I'd be interested in:

1. **A simple example** demonstrating how to use `discretize_distributions` to approximate a 2D Gaussian mixture distribution and how to inspect the approximation quality.

2. An explanation of the **quantization algorithms** employed—how do they differ from naive discretization or sampling-based methods?

3. How the package provides **provable Wasserstein distance error bounds**—is this via theoretical guarantees or empirical bounds?

Feel free to start with whichever you think is most helpful!
