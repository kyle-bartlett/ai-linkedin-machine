Thank you for the summary of the paper with arXiv ID 2511.10893v2. To recap:

The paper presents a **multi-view ensemble approach** to polymer property prediction, integrating four complementary representation families:

1. **Tabular descriptors** (e.g., RDKit features, Morgan fingerprints),
2. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** capturing polymer graph structures,
3. **3D-aware representations** incorporating spatial molecular information,
4. **Pretrained SMILES language models** leveraging deep learning on chemical strings.

Key points include:

- Per-property models for each representation family,
- Uniform averaging of predictions across these views,
- 10-fold cross-validation for model robustness,
- Test-time augmentation (TTA) via SMILES perturbations to improve generalization.

Performance highlights:

- Ranked **9th out of 2241 teams** in the **NeurIPS 2025 Open Polymer Property Prediction Challenge**,
- Achieved MAE of **0.057 (public leaderboard)** and **0.082 (private leaderboard)**,
- Showcasing enhanced predictive accuracy through multimodal molecular representations and ensemble methods.
