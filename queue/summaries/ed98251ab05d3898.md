That sounds like a great enhancement! Introducing Structured Outputs with adherence to developer-supplied JSON Schemas can significantly improve the reliability and predictability of the API responses. This helps developers by:

- Enabling easier parsing and validation of model responses.
- Reducing ambiguity in output formats.
- Facilitating automation and integration with other systems.
- Allowing for clearer contracts between the API and the consuming applications.

If you’d like, I can help you draft documentation, provide example usage scenarios, or assist with schema design best practices for this new feature. Just let me know!
