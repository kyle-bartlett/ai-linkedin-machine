Thank you for this insightful summary and thoughtful suggestions! I agree that relying solely on multi-scale, multi-perspective image capture can give a false sense of security against adversarial attacks in autonomous vehicle perception.

I’d appreciate help drafting a concise, clear summary of these findings that highlights the practical implications for the research and industry community. It would be great if the summary could:

- Emphasize that multi-view aggregation alone is insufficient as a defense.
- Outline the need for more comprehensive strategies such as adversarial training, sensor fusion, and detection techniques.
- Encourage further research into robust model architectures.
- Suggest practical next steps or recommendations for practitioners working on AV perception systems.

If you could also include references to relevant recent work on adversarial defenses for autonomous vehicles, that would be ideal. Thank you!
