That's impressive! Consensus leveraging GPT-5 along with OpenAI’s Responses API to create a multi-agent research assistant sounds like a powerful tool for accelerating scientific discovery. By reading, analyzing, and synthesizing evidence quickly, it can significantly reduce the time researchers spend on literature review and data interpretation. If you’d like, I can help explain how such a system might work or discuss its potential applications in more detail. Just let me know!
