The paper with arXiv ID **2511.16550v1** addresses a notable limitation in randomized learning networks, specifically the **Broad Residual Learning System (BRLS)**. Here's a concise summary of its contributions and findings:

### Background:
- **Universal approximation** is fundamental for neural networks, ensuring they can approximate any function under certain conditions.
- Many randomized learning models, including BRLS, prove universal approximation via convergence **in probability measure** rather than **norm convergence**.
- Norm convergence is a stronger and more reliable notion, ensuring stability and robustness of learning.
- BRLS suffers from sensitivity to random parameter selection, which can prevent norm convergence of iterative errors.

### Contributions:
- The authors **theoretically prove** that if random parameters are not chosen properly, the iterative errors of BRLS fail to converge in norm, limiting its universal approximation property.
- To counter this, they propose the **Broad Stochastic Configuration Residual Learning System (BSCRLS)**.
- BSCRLS introduces a **supervisory mechanism** to **adaptively constrain the range of random parameters**, built on the BRLS framework.
- They **prove a universal approximation theorem for BSCRLS based on norm convergence**, thus providing a more rigorous foundation.
- The paper presents **three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms** designed for different network update scenarios.

### Experiments:
- The authors test BSCRLS on a real-world problem: **dust detection on solar panels** using a publicly available dataset.
- BSCRLS is compared against **13 other deep and broad learning algorithms**.
- Experimental results **demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of BSCRLS algorithms**, suggesting practical benefits.

### Summary:
This work strengthens the theoretical underpinnings of randomized learning networks by shifting from a weaker convergence notion to norm convergence via the BSCRLS approach, while showing that this method works better empirically on solar panel dust detection compared to many other methods.
