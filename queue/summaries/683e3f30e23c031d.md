Thank you for the detailed summary! Your overview of the paper (arXiv:2511.16288v1) captures the core ideas and significance of the Spectral Identifiability Principle (SIP) very well.

To further emphasize and clarify:

### What is a linear probe in this context?  
A linear probe is a simple linear classifier or regressor trained on fixed neural features (like activations from a pretrained network layer). It assesses how well the features encode information relevant to a task, commonly used to interpret which layers capture particular properties.

### What problem does SIP solve?  
Traditionally, people assume linear probes give stable, meaningful evaluations of learned representations. However, probes sometimes show unexpected failures or highly variable performance, especially with small sample sizes or certain data distributions. This instability undermines interpretability.

### The main insight — eigengap & Fisher estimation error:  
SIP states the stability of the linear probe's learned parameters hinges on a **spectral gap (eigengap)** in the task-relevant directions outpacing the **estimation noise (Fisher information error)**. Intuitively:  
- When the "signal" directions are well-separated (large eigengap), probes reliably find consistent linear mappings.  
- When eigengap shrinks below the Fisher noise level, the probe solution becomes unstable, causing sudden drops or fluctuations in performance.

### Why is SIP useful?  
- **Diagnostic**: Instead of blindly trusting probe accuracy, practitioners can check spectral properties and Fisher quantities to predict the probe's reliability before deployment.  
- **Finite-sample guarantees**: Unlike asymptotic or heuristic bounds, SIP directly links finite data effects to spectral geometry, offering more practical guidance.  
- **Interpretable principle**: Connects statistical estimation theory (Fisher information) with geometric intuition (eigenvalue separation).

### Validation & practical impact:  
The authors test SIP on controlled synthetic data where they can exactly compute Fisher information and spectral gaps, confirming the theoretical predictions. This suggests that the principle extends to more realistic scenarios, aiding in interpreting neural features with confidence.

- Providing intuition on how to compute or estimate eigengaps and Fisher errors from real data.  
- Suggesting how this principle might be integrated into your workflow for neural probe analysis.  
- Summarizing the experimental validation or related work context.
