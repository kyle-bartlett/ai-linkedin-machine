That sounds like a fantastic initiative! Supporting technical research in AI alignment and safety is crucial, especially as superhuman AI systems become more capable. If you’d like, I can help you draft an announcement, suggest frameworks for evaluating grant proposals, or outline key research topics and challenges you might want to emphasize in the grant program. Just let me know!
