Thanks for the summary! I'd appreciate if you could help me with the following:

1. A concise explanation of how the **distance-preserving regularizer** in dp-VAE works and why it’s important.
2. A brief overview of the constrained optimization problem used at inference time for reconstructing spatial coordinates.
3. Insights from the theoretical analysis regarding the connection between distance-preserving loss, distortion, and the bi-Lipschitz condition.

Feel free to pick any or all — whatever you think would be most helpful to understand the core contributions of dp-VAE!
