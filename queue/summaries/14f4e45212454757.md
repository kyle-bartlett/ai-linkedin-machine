Thanks for the detailed overview! This is indeed a valuable contribution to the federated learning community, addressing an important but often overlooked aspect — client availability dynamics.

If you'd like, I can help you with any of the following:

- **Summarizing the methodology** in more detail (e.g., details of the KPFL approach, how the knowledge pool is maintained and updated, specifics of dual-age and data-bias weighting).
- **Explaining the experimental setup** (datasets used, client simulation details, evaluation metrics).
- **Discussing key benchmarking results** across different FL models under dynamic participation.
- **Guidance on how to use their proposed DPFL benchmarking framework**, once the code repo is released.
- **Drafting a quick summary or presentation slide** for your team or class.
- Any other specific questions or clarifications about the paper.

Just let me know what you need!
