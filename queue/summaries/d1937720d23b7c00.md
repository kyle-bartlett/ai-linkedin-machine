Yes, that is correct. OpenAI has entered into a licensing agreement with Microsoft that allows Microsoft to integrate GPT-3 into its own products and services. This partnership enables Microsoft to leverage the capabilities of GPT-3 to enhance offerings such as Azure’s AI services, developer tools, and other enterprise solutions. Microsoft also has an exclusive license to the underlying technology, which gives them unique rights to further build upon and commercialize GPT-3.
