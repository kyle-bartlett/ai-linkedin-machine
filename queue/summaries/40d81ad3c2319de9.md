The paper (arXiv:2502.04695v2) focuses on the role of explainability metrics in private AI governance, especially as AI systems are increasingly deployed in sensitive and high-stakes domains. Here's a summary of the key points:

- **Motivation:** Reliable explainability is crucial not just technically but also for trustworthy private AI governance. Stakeholders like auditors, insurers, certification bodies, and procurement agencies require standardized and robust evaluation metrics to assess AI trustworthiness.

- **Current Challenges:** Existing explainable AI (XAI) evaluation metrics are fragmented and vulnerable to manipulation, which hinders accountability and regulatory compliance.

- **Core Argument:** Standardized explainability metrics should be viewed as *governance primitives*. This means embedding auditability and accountability into AI systems to enable effective oversight by private actors.

- **Technical Focus:** The work addresses key limitations in current evaluation metrics regarding:
  - Faithfulness (how well explanations reflect true model behavior)
  - Tamper resistance (resilience against gaming/manipulation)
  - Regulatory alignment (supporting legal and compliance frameworks)

- **Interpretability & Model Alignment:** The paper highlights how interpretability supports model behavioral integrity in General Purpose AI (GPAI), providing a verifiable method to prevent "alignment faking"—a situation where models appear aligned with values/goals but behave otherwise.

- **Governance by Metrics Paradigm:** The authors propose a new paradigm treating explanation evaluation as a *central mechanism* of private AI governance. This paradigm links key properties:
  - Transparency
  - Tamper resistance
  - Scalability
  - Legal alignment

- **Hierarchical Model:** Their framework extends explainability evaluation from just inspecting models to enabling broader systemic accountability.

- **Roadmap:** Finally, they chart a path to integrate explainability metrics into continuous AI assurance pipelines that can serve private oversight needs and regulatory compliance simultaneously.

**In short**, this work advances explainability evaluation from a purely technical challenge to a foundational element of AI governance, enabling trustworthy oversight in high-impact applications. It emphasizes standardization, robustness, and legal compliance as essential features of future XAI metrics.
