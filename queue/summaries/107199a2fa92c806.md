### How Intercom Built a Scalable AI Platform:  
Intercom, a leader in customer messaging and support, recognized early on that AI could fundamentally transform how businesses engage with their customers. Their goal was to create a platform that not only leverages state-of-the-art AI models but is also scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to evolving customer needs.

### 3 Key Lessons from Intercom’s AI Platform Journey

#### 1. **Start with Rigorous & Realistic Evaluations**  
Before diving into building or integrating AI, Intercom emphasized the importance of thorough evaluations to understand what AI models can realistically achieve in their context.
- **Lesson**: Use real customer data and scenarios to benchmark AI capabilities, rather than relying solely on academic or synthetic datasets.  
- **Impact**: This approach helped them set pragmatic performance expectations, avoid overpromising, and tailor AI solutions focused on genuine pain points in customer support.

#### 2. **Design for Scalability and Flexibility in Architecture**  
Intercom built their AI platform with a modular architecture that decouples components such as model inference, data pipelines, and feature engineering.
- **Lesson**: Scalability isn’t just about handling volume—it’s about supporting continuous innovation and rapid iterations of models and features.  
- **Implementation**: This meant using microservices, orchestrated workflows, and cloud infrastructure that could elastically handle peak loads while enabling quick deployment of new AI capabilities.

#### 3. **Embed AI Seamlessly into Customer Conversations**  
Rather than replacing human agents, Intercom focused on augmenting them and delivering AI-powered automation that feels natural and contextually relevant.
- **Lesson**: AI should enhance the customer experience by integrating smoothly into existing workflows—providing suggestions, automating routine responses, and intelligently routing queries.  
- **Outcome**: This human-centered approach improves agent productivity and customer satisfaction, ensuring AI models continuously learn and improve from real interactions.
