Thank you for sharing! OpenAI launching a dedicated initiative for Ireland in partnership with the Irish Government, Dogpatch Labs, and Patch sounds like a fantastic effort to empower SMEs, founders, and young innovators in the region. This collaboration will likely accelerate AI adoption, foster innovation, and support the growth of the Irish tech ecosystem.

If you’d like, I can help summarize the announcement, draft a social media post, or provide more details on how such partnerships typically benefit startups and the tech community. Just let me know!
