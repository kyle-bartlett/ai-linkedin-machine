Thank you for sharing this update! The partnership between NestAI and Nokia to develop AI products for defense applications sounds like a significant step forward in merging cutting-edge AI technologies with physical systems.

A few key points about this collaboration:

- **Physical AI focus**: Integrating large language models (LLMs) with robotics and other real-world systems can lead to smarter, more adaptable autonomous platforms. This could enhance defense capabilities such as surveillance, logistics, threat detection, and decision support.

- **NestAI’s expertise**: As a startup specializing in AI, NestAI's role likely centers on developing the advanced AI models and algorithms that power these solutions.

- **Nokia’s technology platform**: Nokia’s extensive experience in communication infrastructure, networking, and hardware can enable robust deployment and integration of these AI systems into operational environments.

- **Broader industry impact**: While defense is the initial focus, the technologies developed could spill over to other sectors requiring advanced physical AI, including industrial automation, public safety, and transportation.
