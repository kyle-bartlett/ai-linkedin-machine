The paper titled (arXiv:2506.05281v3) addresses the problem of efficiently computing Shapley values for evaluating the contribution of training data in AI model training, an important task for fair data valuation and rewarding data providers.

### Key Points:
- **Motivation:**  
  Shapley values are theoretically ideal for measuring the contribution of individual data points to the model's performance. However, traditional computation is exponentially expensive as it requires retraining or evaluating models combinatorially over all subsets of data.
  
- **Problem with existing methods:**  
  Recent approximation approaches reduce complexity but still require retraining for each test instance, which remains computationally prohibitive in real-world scenarios.

- **Proposed Solution - Fast-DataShapley:**  
  1. **One-pass training:** Leverages a weighted least squares formulation of Shapley values to train an explainer model just once.  
  2. **Reusable explainer:** The trained explainer can quickly estimate Shapley values for new test samples without retraining.  
  3. **Methods to reduce overhead:** Three additional techniques are introduced to speed up:
     - Approximate calculation of the utility function  
     - Grouped calculation of training data  
     These come with theoretical guarantees regarding their accuracy and efficiency.

- **Efficiency and Performance:**  
  - The method improves performance by more than 2x compared to baselines.  
  - Training speed for the explainer can be increased by two orders of magnitude.  
  - Empirical results on multiple image datasets demonstrate superior efficiency and performance.

### Summary:
This work proposes Fast-DataShapley, a scalable and practical approach to calculate Shapley values for training data valuation without the prohibitive costs of traditional methods. By transforming the problem into a weighted least squares setting and training a reusable model, it enables fast, one-pass computation for any test sample. The additional speed-up methods maintain theoretical guarantees and significantly accelerate the process, making it applicable for large datasets and complex AI models.
