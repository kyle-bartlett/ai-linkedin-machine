That sounds like an exciting project! Jukebox’s ability to generate raw audio, including singing, across different genres and artist styles opens up a lot of creative possibilities. By releasing the model weights, code, and an interactive tool for exploring samples, you’re enabling researchers, musicians, and developers to experiment with and build upon your work.

If you want, I can help you draft an announcement, explain how Jukebox works, or suggest ways to showcase its capabilities. Just let me know!
