The paper (arXiv:2408.17329v2) presents an innovative study demonstrating that ECG data, combined with demographic information and analyzed through an XGBoost model, can predict not only cardiac but also a variety of non-cardiac medical conditions with good accuracy (AUROC > 0.7). Using large publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV-ECG-ICD and ECG-VIEW II), the authors systematically explored diagnostic capabilities beyond traditional cardiac uses of ECG and found significant predictive value for 44 conditions in total (23 cardiac and 21 non-cardiac). This work highlights the underexplored potential of ECG features for broader diagnostic applications, potentially contributing to earlier detection and diagnosis of various diseases using a widely available, non-invasive clinical tool.
