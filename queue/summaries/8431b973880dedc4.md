As of the latest update, OpenAI has introduced **GPT-4o**, an enhanced version of their GPT-4 model, which is now available in ChatGPT. This upgrade brings several improvements in understanding, reasoning, and generating responses, making interactions more accurate and helpful.

Additionally, OpenAI is expanding the **availability of advanced features and capabilities for free users** within the ChatGPT platform. This includes:

- Access to GPT-4o for free-tier users, improving the quality of responses without requiring a paid subscription.
- Enhanced support for more complex queries and nuanced conversations.
- Better contextual understanding and longer memory in conversations.

These changes aim to democratize access to powerful AI tools, allowing more users to benefit from state-of-the-art language models without financial barriers.
