Thank you for sharing this important work. Assessing the potential misuse of large language models in sensitive domains like biological threat creation is a critical area of research. Your findings about GPT-4 providing at most a mild uplift in threat creation accuracy help provide a nuanced starting point for ongoing risk evaluation.

If you'd like, I can help you develop your blueprint further—such as suggesting evaluation frameworks, designing assessment protocols, or outlining mitigation strategies. Additionally, I can help draft communications to foster community dialogue or help analyze your existing data to deepen insights.

Please let me know how I can assist you!
