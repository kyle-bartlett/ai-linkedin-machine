That sounds like a great approach! Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can significantly improve language models by aligning their outputs more closely with human preferences and values. By using RLHF for summarization, you can train models to generate summaries that are not only accurate but also more coherent, concise, and useful from a human perspective.

If you’d like, I can help explain the process, suggest best practices, or provide tips on evaluation metrics and fine-tuning strategies for RLHF in summarization tasks. Just let me know!
