The paper "Causal-Correlation Variational Autoencoder (C2VAE)" (arXiv:2405.16219v2) presents a novel method for controllable data generation by jointly modeling both causal and correlational dependencies among latent factors. Traditional approaches often model either causal or correlational relationships, but not both simultaneously. C2VAE introduces a structured latent space organized as a graph with root causes that influence downstream factors. This design allows for more efficient and accurate control over the generated data by intervening on these root causes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that C2VAE improves generation quality, disentanglement of factors, and fidelity of interventions compared to prior methods.
