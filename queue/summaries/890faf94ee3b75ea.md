Thank you for the detailed summary of **"CausalMamba"**! This framework indeed tackles an important and challenging problem—rumor detection—with a strong emphasis on causal interpretability, which is often missing in conventional models.

If you want, here are some ways I could help you next:

1. **Explain key components and techniques**:
   - How the **Mamba-based sequence modeling** works for temporal data.
   - What **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)** contribute in modeling propagation structures.
   - The role of **NOTEARS** in differentiable causal graph discovery.

2. **Clarify the notion of counterfactual intervention**:
   - How does the model simulate removing “key nodes” and assess their impact?
   - Why is this valuable for interpretability and controlling rumor spread?

3. **Discuss potential applications or implications** beyond rumor detection:
   - Can this approach be generalized to other misinformation domains or social contagion problems?

4. **Analyze possible limitations or challenges**:
   - For example, scalability to large datasets or reliance on accurate causal graph recovery.

5. **Provide a step-by-step explanation of the methodology** if you have access to parts of the full paper.

Just let me know which direction interests you most!
