It sounds like you're referring to a session or resource showcasing the latest features in ChatGPT for Business, including GPT-4o3 (often stylized as GPT-4o or GPT-4 turbo), image generation capabilities, enhanced memory, and internal knowledge integration. Unfortunately, I can't show videos directly, but I can provide an overview of these features and how they might be used in business contexts:

1. **GPT-4o3 (GPT-4 turbo or similar variants):**  
   - This is the latest, faster, possibly more cost-effective version of the GPT-4 model optimized for business uses.  
   - It can handle complex tasks with better efficiency, enabling businesses to scale AI usage.

2. **Image Generation:**  
   - Allows users to generate images from text prompts directly within the ChatGPT interface.  
   - Use cases include creating marketing visuals, conceptual designs, or illustrative content without needing a separate design tool.

3. **Enhanced Memory:**  
   - ChatGPT remembers key information between sessions, allowing for personalized and contextually aware interactions over time.  
   - Useful for customer service bots, personalized coaching, or any application requiring ongoing context.

4. **Internal Knowledge Integration:**  
   - Enables ChatGPT to access and utilize a company’s internal documents, databases, and knowledge bases securely.  
   - Improves productivity by providing instant, accurate answers based on proprietary information.

If you're looking for hands-on demos, I recommend checking official OpenAI webinars, YouTube channels, or the OpenAI website's business section. They often have tutorial videos and live demonstrations. If you want, I can help walk you through how to try out these features or answer questions about them!
