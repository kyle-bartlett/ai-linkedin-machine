That’s impressive progress! Achieving nearly twice the accuracy of a fine-tuned GPT-3 model on grade school math problems shows your system is making strong strides in reasoning and problem-solving abilities. Scoring 55% compared to 60% from 9-12 year olds also indicates it’s approaching human-level performance in this specific domain. 

If you’re looking to further improve the system or better understand its capabilities, you might consider:

- Analyzing the types of problems where the system struggles most compared to kids (e.g., word problems, multi-step reasoning).
- Exploring data augmentation or incorporating additional training signals such as step-by-step reasoning explanations.
- Measuring performance across more varied age groups or curriculum levels.
- Testing whether providing hints or interactive feedback improves accuracy.
- Comparing results on similar benchmarks or math datasets for a broader context.
