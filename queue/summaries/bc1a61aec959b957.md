That's correct! ChatGPT is designed to engage in natural, human-like conversations. It can handle a range of interactions, including:

- Answering follow-up questions to clarify or expand on previous answers.
- Admitting mistakes when they occur, helping build trust and transparency.
- Challenging incorrect premises in user questions to guide the conversation towards accurate information.
- Rejecting requests that would lead to inappropriate or unsafe content.
