That sounds like a great enhancement! Fine-tuning GPT-3 to effectively use a text-based web browser can significantly improve its ability to handle open-ended questions by accessing up-to-date information and providing more accurate, context-aware responses.

If you'd like, I can help you with:

- Best practices for fine-tuning GPT-3 with browser interaction capabilities.
- Designing prompts to maximize the synergy between GPT-3 and the web browser.
- Handling ambiguous or complex queries using web context.
- Integrating the browser's output back into the model's reasoning process.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
