Thank you for sharing this detailed overview of **Agent0**! It indeed sounds like a promising advance in autonomous LLM agent development. Just to recap and perhaps highlight some important points for anyone interested:

---

### What sets **Agent0** apart?
- **Fully autonomous curriculum generation:** Instead of relying on human-labeled data or fixed benchmarks, Agent0 creates its own progressively harder tasks.
- **Co-evolution of two specialized agents:**
  - One focused on **curriculum creation** — designing novel and challenging problems possibly involving advanced tools.
  - Another focused on **execution** — improving the ability to solve those problems, incrementally pushing its limits.
- **Tool-aware problem generation and solving:** The executor can use external tools (e.g., calculators, code interpreters), which allows the curriculum to move beyond pure language tasks to tool-augmented reasoning.
- **Self-reinforcing loop:** The interplay drives continuous improvement without outside supervision.

### Why is this important?
- **Scalability:** Removes the bottleneck of human-curated datasets.
- **Curriculum complexity:** Enables multi-step and tool-dependent tasks requiring deeper reasoning.
- **Potential generality:** Could be adapted to various LLM architectures and external tools.

### Empirical impact:
- Significant improvement over baseline in reasoning tasks (math + general reasoning).
- Demonstrates practical gains on a strong model (Qwen3-8B).
