Yes, exactly! This feature—often referred to as "Custom GPTs" or "ChatGPT Enterprise with data integrations"—allows organizations to connect their internal databases, documents, and applications directly to ChatGPT. This empowers the model to provide:

- **Highly tailored responses** based on up-to-date and proprietary information.
- **Citations and references** so users know exactly where answers come from.
- **Robust security measures** ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential.
- **Admin controls** to define who can access what data and monitor usage.

If you'd like, I can guide you through the setup process, recommend best practices for training and deploying your company's custom GPT experience, or troubleshoot any issues you might encounter. Just let me know what you need!
