- **Overview:** A brief description of what Voice Engine is and its purpose.
- **Setup & Training:** Insights on data requirements, training time, and technical setup.
- **Performance:** How well the custom voices matched expectations in naturalness and clarity.
- **Challenges:** Any hurdles faced, such as data quality, model limitations, or user experience issues.

- **Next Steps:** Plans for scaling, improvements, or broader deployment.

Feel free to share details you want included, and I can help organize or expand on them!
