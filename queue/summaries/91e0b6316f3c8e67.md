Absolutely! Choosing the right problems is fundamental to making meaningful scientific contributions. Working on problems that truly matter ensures that the time, effort, and resources invested lead to outcomes that can advance understanding, influence policy, improve technology, or benefit society in concrete ways. It also helps sustain motivation and engagement, as the researcher can see the value and impact of their work.

Some strategies to identify impactful problems include:

- **Engaging with Real-World Challenges:** Collaborate with industry, communities, or policymakers to understand pressing needs.
- **Literature Review:** Identify gaps or unresolved questions in existing research that have broad implications.
- **Interdisciplinary Approaches:** Combine insights from multiple fields to tackle complex issues.
- **Long-Term Vision:** Consider the potential downstream effects and scalability of solutions.
- **Feedback Loops:** Continuously assess the relevance and application of your work through external input.

In essence, impact-driven research balances intellectual curiosity with practical significance to contribute solutions that make a difference.
