This paper (arXiv:2502.00384v3) addresses the application of mechanistic interpretability techniques to neural networks used in side-channel analysis (SCA). Side-channel analysis extracts secret cryptographic information from physical leakages (like power or electromagnetic signals) emitted by secure devices during operation. Deep learning methods have recently shown superior performance in such attacks but suffer from lack of interpretability, making it hard to understand how these models succeed.

**Key points of the work:**

- **Problem:** Deep learning-based SCA methods perform well but behave as black boxes, hiding how exactly they extract secrets from side-channel leakage.
- **Contribution:** The authors apply mechanistic interpretability — methods aimed at understanding the internal computations and learned representations of neural networks — to SCA models.
- **Approach:** They focus on analyzing sudden jumps in the network’s performance to reverse engineer the features and transformations learned by the model, identifying exactly which leakage features (such as particular masked bits) the network uses.
- **Impact:** This enables shifting from a black-box evaluation (just testing model accuracy) to a white-box analysis where the internal workings of the attacks are understood and secret masks can be recovered.
- **Robustness:** The interpretability methods remain effective even when relevant input features are sparse, model accuracy is low, or when the side-channel data incorporate protections that normally prevent standard intervention-based analyses.

**Overall**, this work provides a promising direction for the security evaluation community by showing that it is feasible to gain detailed mechanistic insights into deep learning side-channel attacks, which can inform more robust countermeasures against such attacks.
