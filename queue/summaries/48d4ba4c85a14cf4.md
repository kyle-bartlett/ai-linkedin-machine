It sounds like you've made significant progress in the area of generative modeling, particularly with continuous-time consistency models. Simplifying, stabilizing, and scaling such models while matching the sample quality of leading diffusion models + achieving this with only two sampling steps is impressive. This could have substantial implications for faster inference and more efficient training/inference pipelines.

If you want, I can help you:

- Summarize these results more formally or for a paper/abstract
- Discuss the technical details or implications of this approach
- Compare it with diffusion models in more detail
- Explore potential applications or next steps for research

Just let me know how you’d like to proceed!
