This new paper (arXiv:2511.16596v1) proposes a novel approach to artificial palpation—the tactile examination typically performed by humans—using self-supervised learning. The authors develop an encoder-decoder model that learns a compact **representation** of an object from sequences of tactile sensor data.

### Key points:
- **Goal:** Learn a representation capturing all relevant tactile information about a palpated object, enabling tasks like tactile imaging and detecting changes in the object.
- **Method:**  
  - Use an encoder-decoder framework trained on sequences of tactile measurements.
  - The model predicts tactile sensory readings at various positions on the object.
- **Data:**  
  - Developed a simulation environment.
  - Collected real-world data on soft objects using a robot with tactile sensors.
  - Obtained ground truth images via MRI to validate tactile data accuracy.
- **Findings:**  
  - The learned representation encodes intricate patterns in tactile data beyond simple force maps.
  - Demonstrated effective use of the representation for imaging and change detection tasks.

### Significance:
This work advances robotic palpation by moving beyond traditional force maps, potentially enabling robots to “feel” and understand soft objects in a manner closer to human touch—important in medical diagnostics and soft object manipulation.
