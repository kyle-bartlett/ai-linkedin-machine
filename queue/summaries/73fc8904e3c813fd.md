That’s a great summary capturing how DoorDash is scaling AI adoption with a strong focus on employee empowerment. If you’d like, I can help you with:

- Drafting interview questions for Mariana or other DoorDash leaders on this topic  
- Creating an internal communication or training plan outline based on these principles  
- Writing a thought leadership article or blog post centered on AI empowerment at DoorDash  
- Developing talking points for a presentation on AI adoption in the workplace  

Just let me know what you need!
