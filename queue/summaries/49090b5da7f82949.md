That sounds like a promising approach! Fine-tuning language models on a carefully selected, small dataset tailored for certain behavioral values can help steer their outputs in desired directions without requiring massive amounts of data. If you'd like, I can help you brainstorm best practices for creating such datasets, suggest fine-tuning strategies, or discuss evaluation methods to measure the improvement in behavior. How would you like to proceed?
