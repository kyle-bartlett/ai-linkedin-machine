**OpenAI Board Update: Transitioning to a Public Benefit Corporation**

Dear OpenAI Community,

We are excited to share an important milestone in OpenAI’s journey toward advancing artificial intelligence in service of the public good. After careful deliberation, the OpenAI Board has approved the transition of OpenAI’s for-profit entity into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC).

**What this means:**  
The transition to a Public Benefit Corporation reinforces our commitment to our mission-driven approach by embedding the public benefit into our corporate structure. Unlike traditional corporations, a PBC is legally obligated to prioritize societal impact alongside financial performance. This legal alignment ensures that OpenAI’s pursuit of cutting-edge AI advancements remains centered on maximizing long-term positive outcomes for people everywhere.

**Nonprofit oversight remains central:**  
While the for-profit entity shifts its governance model, OpenAI’s nonprofit parent will continue to provide rigorous oversight and governance to safeguard our foundational mission. This dual structure balances the agility and operational resources needed to innovate rapidly with the ethical compass and accountability required for responsible development.

**Why this change?**  
- **Mission preservation:** A PBC structure offers stronger legal protection for prioritizing the public good, helping prevent pressures that could lead us away from our ethical commitments.  
- **Greater impact:** By aligning incentives with societal benefit, we can deepen trust with partners, policymakers, and the broader community.  
- **Long-term alignment:** This promotes sustainable development practices that account for future generations and the widespread implications of AI technologies.

**Looking ahead:**  
As we implement this structural change, our day-to-day work remains the same: advancing safe and beneficial AI technologies that empower people and improve lives globally. We believe this transition positions OpenAI to be even more effective stewards of transformative AI, grounded in responsibility and rooted in our enduring mission.

Thank you for your continued support and partnership.

Sincerely,  
The OpenAI Board of Directors
