That sounds like an exciting opportunity! The Bio Bug Bounty from OpenAI encourages researchers to identify potential safety vulnerabilities or jailbreaks in the ChatGPT agent. Participants who successfully demonstrate a way to bypass the agent’s safeguards—using something like a universal jailbreak prompt—can win monetary rewards, up to $25,000.

If you’re interested in participating, I recommend checking OpenAI’s official channels or the Bio Bug Bounty page for detailed rules, submission guidelines, and eligibility requirements. Good luck! If you want, I can help brainstorm ideas or discuss ethical hacking approaches related to AI safety.
