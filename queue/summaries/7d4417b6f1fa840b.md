Thanks for sharing this update! Here’s a summary of the new OpenAI Baselines implementations you mentioned:

- **A2C (Advantage Actor Critic)**:  
  - A synchronous and deterministic variant of the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm.  
  - Offers equivalent performance to A3C but uses synchronous updates, which can simplify debugging and reproducibility.

- **ACKTR (Actor Critic using Kronecker-Factored Trust Region)**:  
  - A more sample-efficient algorithm compared to TRPO (Trust Region Policy Optimization) and A2C.  
  - Achieves better sample efficiency while requiring only slightly more computation per update than A2C.  
  - Uses Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) optimization to efficiently estimate natural gradients.

These implementations provide strong options for reinforcement learning tasks, balancing sample efficiency and computational cost. If you want, I can help you with code examples, usage tips, or comparisons between these algorithms!
