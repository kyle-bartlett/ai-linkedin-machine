The paper with arXiv ID 2409.19546v5 addresses the theory of stochastic approximation algorithms, particularly focusing on settings with **nonexpansive operators** rather than the more commonly studied contractive operators. This distinction is important because many prior analyses rely on the contraction property to ensure convergence, but such assumptions do not hold in some reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios—specifically, the average reward RL setting.

### Key Contributions:
- **Study of Nonexpansive Stochastic Approximations with Markovian Noise:**  
  The paper analyzes stochastic approximation algorithms where the operator involved is nonexpansive (does not expand distance) and the noise is generated by a Markov process, a realistic assumption in RL where data is often correlated over time.
  
- **Asymptotic and Finite Sample Analysis:**  
  The authors provide both long-run convergence results and finite-time performance bounds, enhancing the theoretical understanding of such algorithms beyond just asymptotic guarantees.

- **Novel Bounds Using the Poisson Equation:**  
  A significant technical contribution is the development of new bounds on noise terms by leveraging solutions to the Poisson equation—a tool that links the Markovian structure of the noise to the convergence behavior of the stochastic approximation.

- **Application to Average Reward Temporal Difference (TD) Learning:**  
  Perhaps the most impactful result is the first proof of convergence of classical tabular average reward TD learning algorithms. Prior to this, convergence guarantees for the average reward setting had been elusive due to the lack of contraction. The authors show that these algorithms converge to a sample-path dependent fixed point, a nuanced but important form of convergence.

### Why This Matters:
In reinforcement learning, many algorithms rely on stochastic approximation techniques. Most traditional analyses assume contractive mappings to prove convergence, which doesn't hold in average reward problems. This paper bridges that gap, providing theoretical tools and convergence guarantees that can help practitioners and theorists better understand and design algorithms in average reward RL and possibly other settings with nonexpansive operators.
