The paper titled by arXiv:2511.05704v2 proposes **TabDistill**, a method for improving tabular data classification in low-data regimes by distilling knowledge from complex, pre-trained transformer-based models into simpler neural networks. Key points from the abstract include:

- Transformer models have shown strong performance on tabular data with limited training examples (few-shot learning) by leveraging pre-trained knowledge.
- These transformers, however, come with higher complexity and many more parameters than classical models like standard neural networks or Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs).
- TabDistill aims to combine the strengths of both approaches by transferring (distilling) the knowledge embedded in large transformer models into simpler, parameter-efficient neural networks.
- The resulting distilled models outperform classical baselines such as logistic regression, XGBoost, and regular neural networks when trained on the same limited data.
- Impressively, in some cases, distilled models even outperform the original transformer models they were distilled from, highlighting effective knowledge transfer.
