Lyndon Barrois, a filmmaker, discusses using Sora—a digital reading platform commonly used in educational settings—as a storytelling tool by leveraging its features to enhance narrative engagement. He highlights how Sora’s accessibility to diverse digital books, audiobooks, and interactive content allows storytellers and educators to create immersive experiences for their audiences. By integrating Sora’s multisensory elements, such as audio narration and visual text, storytellers can cater to various learning styles, enrich character development, and deepen thematic exploration. Barrois emphasizes that using Sora encourages active participation, making storytelling more dynamic and collaborative, especially in classroom environments. This approach transforms traditional storytelling into a multimodal experience that resonates with modern audiences.
