The paper arXiv:2510.13560v2 studies an extension of the classical online convex optimization (OCO) framework to handle multiple loss sequences simultaneously, introducing a multi-objective OCO model.

### Key points from the abstract:

- **Classical OCO setup:**  
  - A single sequence of convex loss functions is revealed over time horizon \( T \).  
  - At each time \( t \), the algorithm chooses an action before seeing the loss function \( f_t \).  
  - Performance is measured by regret relative to the best fixed action in hindsight.

- **Multi-objective OCO setting:**  
  - Consider \( K \) distinct sequences of convex loss functions, each generating losses at time \( t \).  
  - The algorithm chooses one action per time slot \( t \) without knowing any of the \( K \) losses at \( t \).  
  - The benchmark benchmark (offline optimal) chooses a single static action minimizing the **maximum** of the \( K \) total losses.  
  - The performance measure is the **min-max regret**: the online algorithm’s min-max cost minus the offline benchmark’s min-max cost.  
  - The min-max regret requires the online algorithm to track all \( K \) sequences well simultaneously, making it a strict and challenging criterion.

- **Assumptions and contributions:**  
  - They assume the loss functions are i.i.d. drawn from an unknown distribution.  
  - They propose a simple algorithm combining the Hedge algorithm (for handling multiple objectives) and online gradient descent (OGD) (for convex optimization).  
  - The key theoretical result: an expected min-max regret bound of \( O(\sqrt{T \log K}) \).  
  - The proof is noted to be remarkably simple.

### Significance:

This work generalizes classical OCO to multi-objective settings, which is important for applications where decisions impact multiple criteria or stakeholders, and the algorithm must perform well across all of them. The \( O(\sqrt{T \log K}) \) regret bound nicely scales logarithmically with the number of objectives \( K \), which is efficient and desirable.
