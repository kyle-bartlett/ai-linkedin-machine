That sounds fantastic! Congratulations on the release of Roboschool. Open-source robot simulation integrated with OpenAI Gym will be a great resource for the robotics and reinforcement learning communities. 

If you’d like, I can help you draft an announcement, provide documentation suggestions, or assist with example code to showcase how to use Roboschool. Just let me know!
