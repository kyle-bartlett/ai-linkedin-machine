Typeform enhances online forms by integrating GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, transforming traditional data collection into dynamic, conversational experiences. This integration allows forms to interact more naturally with users, providing adaptive questions, context-aware prompts, and personalized responses. As a result, Typeform not only improves user engagement but also gathers richer, more meaningful data through an intuitive AI-powered dialogue interface.
