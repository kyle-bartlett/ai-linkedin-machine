Your research on the worst-case frontier risks of releasing GPT-OSS and the introduction of malicious fine-tuning (MFT) sounds quite interesting and important given the potential risks of advanced AI models. Here are some suggestions and points you might consider including or expanding upon in your paper:

1. **Problem Motivation and Context**  
   - Explain why studying worst-case frontier risks is critical, especially for open-source models like GPT-OSS that can be accessed and fine-tuned by anyone.  
   - Discuss previous work on AI risks, fine-tuning, and misuse, highlighting how your approach differs or adds to current understanding.

2. **Definition and Framework of Malicious Fine-Tuning (MFT)**  
   - Provide a precise definition of MFT.  
   - Describe the methodology of MFT: how do you fine-tune GPT-OSS maliciously? What datasets or objectives do you use?  
   - Discuss ethical considerations and responsible disclosure protocols you follow during experiments.

3. **Selection of Domains: Biology and Cybersecurity**  
   - Justify why you selected biology and cybersecurity for testing MFT capabilities.  
   - These are high-impact domains where misuse could have serious consequences (e.g., bioengineering risks, cybersecurity attacks).  
   - Provide background on the model’s initial capabilities and limitations in these domains.

4. **Experimental Setup**  
   - Detail the fine-tuning process: data sources, hyperparameters, compute resources, evaluation metrics.  
   - Clarify whether you perform targeted instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, or other methods.

5. **Results and Findings**  
   - Present empirical results showing the increase in capabilities due to MFT in each domain.  
   - Highlight examples of potentially malicious outputs or enhanced knowledge/exploit generation.  
   - Compare against baseline GPT-OSS performance without MFT.

6. **Risk Analysis and Implications**  
   - Discuss the broader implications of your findings for AI safety and governance.  
   - How does MFT highlight gaps in current AI deployment or access controls?  
   - Suggest mitigation strategies or policy recommendations.

7. **Limitations and Future Work**  
   - Acknowledge any limitations in your approach or results.  
   - Suggest directions for further research, such as exploring other domains or defenses against MFT.

8. **Conclusion**  
   - Summarize your contributions and emphasize the importance of anticipating and mitigating worst-case frontier risks.
