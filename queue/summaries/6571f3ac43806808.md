**Study on the Economic Impacts of Large Language Models**

**Background:**  
Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, PaLM, and others have rapidly transformed various sectors by enabling advanced natural language processing capabilities. These technologies impact productivity, job markets, innovation trajectories, and economic structures at large. Understanding their economic implications is critical for policymakers, businesses, and society to navigate opportunities and risks effectively.

**Objective:**  
We invite researchers, academic institutions, think tanks, and specialized consultancy firms to express their interest in conducting a comprehensive study on the economic impacts of large language models. This study aims to analyze how LLMs influence economic productivity, labor markets, sectoral shifts, innovation, and distributional effects across different regions and demographics.

**Scope of Work:**  
The study should address, but is not limited to:  
- Macroeconomic impacts of LLM adoption and diffusion  
- Influence of LLMs on labor demand, job displacement, and creation  
- Effects on productivity and processes across key economic sectors  
- Economic benefits and risks related to equity, inclusiveness, and regional disparities  
- Implications for innovation ecosystems and market dynamics  
- Policy recommendations to maximize benefits and mitigate risks

**Who Should Apply:**  
We welcome applications from qualified entities with expertise in economics, artificial intelligence, technology impact assessment, labor economics, or related fields. Proven experience in conducting large-scale economic research and familiarity with AI technologies is highly desirable.
