That sounds fascinating! Using simulation to train an AI for spam detection and then deploying it on a physical robot is a very innovative approach. Could you share more details about how the simulation environment was designed, what kinds of data or scenarios the AI was trained on, and how the robot uses the AI in real-world settings? I'd love to understand more about the technical aspects and potential applications!
