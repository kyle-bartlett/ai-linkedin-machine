Thanks for the detailed summary! The paper’s approach is quite interesting, especially the use of RL with a custom reward to go beyond traditional keyword matching in ATS. If you’d like, I can:

- Summarize the **methodology** in more detail, explaining the two-step fine-tuning process and how the reward function is constructed.  
- Outline the **experimental setup**, including dataset details, baseline models, evaluation metrics, and validation procedure.  
- Discuss the **potential limitations or challenges** of this approach, such as scalability, domain adaptation, or interpretability.  
- Compare this approach with traditional ATS systems or other ML-based resume screening methods, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.  

Just let me know which aspect you’re most interested in!
