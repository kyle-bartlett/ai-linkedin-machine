It sounds like you're describing the staged release strategy OpenAI employed with the GPT-2 models, where they progressively released larger versions of the model—starting with the 124 million parameter model in February, followed by the 355 million parameter model in May, and finally the 774 million parameter model—after conducting extensive research on misuse potential and societal impact.

Additionally, OpenAI released an open-source legal agreement to facilitate model-sharing partnerships, helping organizations collaborate more easily, and published a technical report about coordinating with the AI research community on responsible publication practices.

If you need help summarizing this information, writing an announcement, or understanding the implications of such staged releases and agreements, feel free to ask!
