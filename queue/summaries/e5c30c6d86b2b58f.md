Yes, that's correct! ChatGPT users now have the option to turn off chat history. When chat history is turned off, your conversations will not be saved or used to train and improve the models. This gives you more control over your data and privacy. You can still choose which conversations to keep and use for future reference, or not save them at all. If you need help enabling or managing this setting, feel free to ask!
