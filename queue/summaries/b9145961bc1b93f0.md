The paper with arXiv ID 2511.16475v1 reports a comparative study of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, focusing on their performance in the ANT continuous control environment under different reward density conditions (dense vs. sparse rewards). The main points are:

- **Context:** Offline RL learns policies from fixed datasets without exploring the environment, which is crucial when environment interaction is costly or unsafe.

- **Algorithms compared:**
  - **Decision Transformer (DT):** A sequence modeling approach that formulates offline RL as a problem of predicting future actions in a trajectory, inspired by transformer architectures from NLP.
  - **Conservative Q-Learning (CQL):** A value-based offline RL algorithm designed to remain conservative to avoid overestimating Q-values for unseen actions.
  - **Implicit Q-Learning (IQL):** Another value-based offline RL method focusing on learning implicit value functions.

- **Key findings:**
  - **Decision Transformer (DT)** is less sensitive to the reward density of the environment, performing particularly well with medium-expert datasets and sparse rewards.
  - **IQL** shines in dense reward settings, especially when dataset quality is high.
  - **CQL** tends to offer a more balanced performance across different dataset qualities.
  - DT exhibits less variability (i.e., lower variance) in performance but demands significantly more computational resources than IQL or CQL.

- **Implications:**
  - Sequence modeling approaches like DT may be better suited for environments with uncertain or sparse reward signals, or where data quality varies.
  - Traditional value-based offline RL methods remain highly competitive in dense reward environments with high-quality demonstrations.

In summary, this study highlights a complementary suitability of sequence modeling (e.g., DT) and value-based (e.g., IQL, CQL) methods depending on the reward environment and dataset characteristics in offline RL tasks.
