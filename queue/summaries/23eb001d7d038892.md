**Interviewer:** Hi Connor, thank you for joining us today. To start, can you tell us a bit about Speak and what inspired you to co-found the company?

**Connor Zwick:** Thanks for having me! Speak is an edtech company focused on revolutionizing language learning through AI-powered conversations. We aim to provide learners with interactive, real-life speaking practice that’s scalable and accessible anytime, anywhere. The inspiration came from my own struggles learning foreign languages and noticing that while there are many great resources for grammar and vocabulary, there's a huge gap when it comes to practicing real spoken communication — especially in a supportive, low-pressure environment.

**Interviewer:** That’s really interesting. How does Speak use AI to enhance the language learning experience?

**Connor Zwick:** Our AI platform simulates natural conversations in a way that’s personalized to the learner’s level and goals. Unlike traditional apps that focus on drills or passive learning, Speak offers dynamic dialogues where learners can practice speaking and receive immediate feedback on pronunciation, grammar, and fluency. The AI adapts in real-time, presenting new challenges and topics to keep the learner engaged and continuously improving.

**Interviewer:** What are some of the biggest challenges you’ve faced in building Speak?

**Connor Zwick:** Building an AI system that can handle the nuances of human speech — including different accents, speeds, and errors — is incredibly complex. We’ve invested heavily in natural language processing and speech recognition tailored specifically for language learners. Another challenge has been ensuring the experience feels natural and encouraging, so users don’t get frustrated but rather motivated to keep practicing.

**Interviewer:** Looking ahead, what are your goals for Speak in the next few years?

**Connor Zwick:** We want to expand our language offerings and deepen the AI’s conversational abilities, making it feel even more like speaking with a native speaker or tutor. Additionally, we plan to partner with educational institutions and corporations to scale our platform for both individual learners and organizational training. Ultimately, our mission is to make speaking practice accessible to everyone, breaking down barriers to communication worldwide.

**Interviewer:** That’s an exciting vision. Finally, what advice would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs in the edtech space?

**Connor Zwick:** Focus on solving real, meaningful problems. Edtech is a field with enormous potential to impact lives, but it requires a deep understanding of your users and patience to iterate on solutions that truly work. Also, embrace technology, especially AI, but don’t lose sight of the human element — learning is fundamentally a human experience.
