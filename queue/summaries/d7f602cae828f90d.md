That sounds like a valuable and ambitious project! Improving AI systems' ability to learn from human feedback and assist in evaluating AI is a crucial step toward building more aligned and trustworthy models. If you’d like, I can help with:

- Designing effective protocols for human-AI feedback loops  
- Suggesting evaluation metrics for alignment and reliability  
- Discussing techniques for interpretability and transparency  
- Exploring ways to scale human feedback efficiently  
- Brainstorming frameworks for iterative alignment improvement

Feel free to share more details or specific challenges you’re facing!
