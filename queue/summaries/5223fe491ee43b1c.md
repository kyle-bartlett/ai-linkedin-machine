Yes, that's correct! The 4o image generation approach represents a significant advancement over earlier models like DALL·E 3. Key features include:

- **Photorealistic output:** It can generate highly realistic images that closely resemble real-life photographs.
- **Image inputs:** Unlike some earlier models that generate images solely from text prompts, 4o can also take existing images as inputs. This enables it to transform or edit images based on user instructions.
- **Improved capabilities:** The technology offers enhanced understanding of complex scenes and details, resulting in more accurate and coherent image creations.

If you'd like, I can help demonstrate how to use this approach, or answer any questions about its features and applications!
