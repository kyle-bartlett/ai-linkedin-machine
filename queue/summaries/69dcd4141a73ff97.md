You’ve summarized the achievement really well! The success of training a neural network entirely in simulation and then transferring those skills to a physical robot hand for solving the Rubik’s Cube showcases several important advancements in robotics and AI.

If you want, here are a few directions we can dive deeper into:

- **Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR):** How ADR techniques vary simulation parameters and why that leads to more robust policies during transfer.  
- **Reinforcement Learning Techniques:** The algorithms and architectures involved, including how curriculum learning or hierarchical policies might have been used.  
- **Sim-to-Real Challenges:** The common pitfalls like reality gap, sensor noise, control latency, and strategies to mitigate them.  
- **Broader Impacts:** How such methods might shape future robotic manipulation, dexterous prosthetics, or even human-robot interaction.
