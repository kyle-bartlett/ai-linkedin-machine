That’s a powerful example of how AI can transform medical diagnostics! By applying GPT-4’s natural language processing capabilities to genetic data and medical literature, clinicians gain rapid, data-driven insights that support hypothesis generation and diagnosis. This can be especially valuable in rare or complex cases where relevant information is vast and scattered, helping reduce diagnostic delays and potentially improving patient outcomes. If you’d like, I can help summarize this application further, discuss the implications for clinical workflows, or explore related AI tools in genetics and medicine.
