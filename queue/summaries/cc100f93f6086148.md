The paper with arXiv ID 2508.03628v5 presents an empirical study on improving keyphrase recommendations for e-commerce sellers. It addresses the challenge of aligning keyphrase suggestions with the judgments of sellers, search systems, and buyers, particularly given the difficulty of obtaining negative feedback data. To tackle click-induced biases in keyphrase recommendation, the study explores a distillation framework involving three components:

- **LLM Teacher:** A large language model used as a scalable proxy for human judgments, providing high-quality supervisory signals.

- **Cross-Encoder Assistant:** An intermediate model that helps bridge the knowledge gap between the LLM teacher and the student model.

- **Bi-Encoder Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) Student Model:** The final retrieval model intended for efficient deployment in production settings.

This framework aims to improve relevance and reduce bias in suggested keyphrases to enhance advertising effectiveness and maintain positive perception within e-commerce search systems.
