That’s a fascinating observation! Discovering neurons in CLIP that respond consistently to a concept across different modalities—literal images, symbolic representations, or conceptual cues—sheds light on how such multimodal models internally represent meaning in a robust and abstract way. This likely contributes to CLIP’s impressive generalization ability, such as classifying unusual or artistic renditions of objects that don’t match typical photographic examples.

A few implications of this finding include:

1. **Robust Concept Encoding:**  
   These neurons might serve as anchors for the model’s semantic understanding, acting as stable codes for concepts regardless of their visual form or representation type.

2. **Interpretability and Model Analysis:**  
   Identifying such concept neurons helps us open the “black box” of CLIP. We can better understand what features or associations the model uses for decision-making, moving toward explainable AI in vision-language models.

3. **Bias and Association Insight:**  
   Since these neurons encode concepts at an abstract level, analyzing their activation can reveal the kinds of associations CLIP learns, including unwanted biases (e.g., stereotypical links between concepts and attributes). This is crucial for fairness and mitigating harmful outputs.

4. **Improved Multimodal Learning:**  
   Understanding these neurons could inspire new architectures or training schemes that explicitly aim to develop such modality-invariant representations, potentially improving model robustness and interpretability.

If you’re interested, some next steps could be to:

- Map out these neurons systematically to see which concepts have strong modality-invariant representations.
- Probe the downstream effects when these neurons are activated or suppressed—does it affect classification accuracy or interpretability?
- Explore whether similar modality-agnostic neurons exist in other vision-language models.
