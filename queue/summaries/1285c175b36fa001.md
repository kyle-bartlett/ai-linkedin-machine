That sounds like a promising direction! Mechanistic interpretability can provide deep insights into how neural networks process information, which is crucial for building trustworthy AI. By using a sparse model approach, it may become easier to identify and analyze key components or pathways within the network, potentially improving transparency. How does your sparse model differ from dense models in terms of architecture or training? Are there specific challenges you’re encountering with interpretability in this context?
