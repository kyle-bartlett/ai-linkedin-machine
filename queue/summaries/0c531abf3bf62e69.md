Minnesota’s Enterprise Translation Office (ETO) has integrated ChatGPT into its workflow to enhance and streamline language translation services. By leveraging the advanced natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT, the office can more efficiently translate documents, communications, and other materials across multiple languages. This adoption helps bridge language gaps within state government agencies and improves accessibility for non-English speaking residents, ensuring clearer communication and better delivery of public services.
