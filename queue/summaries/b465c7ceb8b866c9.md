The paper **"AutoJudge"** (arXiv:2504.20039v4) proposes a novel method to speed up inference for large language models (LLMs) by using **task-specific lossy speculative decoding**. Here’s a concise summary of the main ideas and contributions:

### Key Idea
- Traditional speculative decoding methods try to match the target LLM's output token-by-token to maintain accuracy.
- AutoJudge relaxes this strict token matching requirement by identifying which generated tokens truly impact the final quality of the response.
- It allows "unimportant" tokens to be generated faster even if they differ from the exact target output distribution, trading a small accuracy loss for much faster speed.

### How It Works
- Uses a **semi-greedy search algorithm** to evaluate which mismatches between a faster “draft” model and the slower “target” model should be corrected to maintain response quality, and which can be ignored.
- Trains a lightweight classifier on embeddings from existing LLMs to predict at inference time which mismatched tokens are safe to accept without hurting the answer quality.
- This classifier guides the speculative decoding by skipping some token corrections to speed up inference.

### Results
- Tested on benchmarks involving **mathematical reasoning** (GSM8k) and **programming tasks** (LiveCodeBench).
- Achieves up to a **2× speedup** on GSM8k with the Llama 3.1 70B model, while sacrificing less than 1% accuracy.
- On programming benchmarks, it accepts 25+ tokens per speculation step at a small accuracy drop (~2% Pass@1).
- Requires **no human annotation** and is easy to integrate with existing LLM inference pipelines.

### Significance
- AutoJudge provides a practical way to leverage faster draft models for token generation without fully matching every token exactly, enabling higher throughput in applications where minor quality trade-offs are acceptable.
- This method is especially useful for tasks where some tokens are less critical to the final output quality, like certain aspects of reasoning or code generation.
