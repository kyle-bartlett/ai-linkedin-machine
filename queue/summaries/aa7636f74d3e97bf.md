Certainly! Below is a template for an **Outbound Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Policy** that your organization can adapt and publish. This policy outlines how your organization responsibly discloses vulnerabilities found in third-party products or services.

# Outbound Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines the process and expectations for disclosing security vulnerabilities discovered by [Organization Name] in products or services developed by third parties. Our goal is to promote responsible and coordinated disclosure to improve overall security while minimizing risks to users and stakeholders.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and affiliates of [Organization Name] who discover security vulnerabilities in external products, services, or systems during their work or research.

## 3. Guiding Principles

- **Responsible Disclosure:** Vulnerabilities will be reported to the affected vendor or maintainer in a responsible manner—privately and securely.
- **Coordination:** We will collaborate with vendors to coordinate the timing of public disclosure to allow for patches or mitigations.
- **Respect for Vendors and Users:** We will avoid public disclosure before the vendor has had a reasonable opportunity to address the vulnerability, except if necessary to protect users.
- **Transparency:** When vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed (either by us or the vendor), we will provide sufficient information to help users understand and address the issue.

## 4. Reporting Process

### 4.1 Identifying a Vulnerability

When a potential security vulnerability is discovered in a third-party product or service:

- The discovering party must document the issue with sufficient technical details to demonstrate and understand the vulnerability.
- Efforts should be made to ensure the vulnerability is not being exploited in the wild before disclosure or to notify the vendor immediately if exploitation is suspected.

### 4.2 Contacting the Vendor

- The vulnerability will be reported privately to the vendor or maintainer using their preferred security disclosure channels (e.g., security email, bug tracker, third-party platforms such as HackerOne or Bugcrowd).
- If no suitable channel is available, the vendor's general contact email may be used, with a request for escalation to the security team.
- Communication will be encrypted (e.g., PGP/GPG) if the vendor provides a public key; otherwise, sensitive information will be sent with care to avoid interception.

### 4.3 Information Provided

The initial report to the vendor should include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce or PoC (Proof of Concept) code if available
- Impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation or remediation ideas if any
- Contact information for follow-up

### 4.4 Follow-up and Coordination

- We will work cooperatively with the vendor to verify the vulnerability and understand its scope.
- We agree to reasonable timelines for the vendor to develop and release a fix, typically up to 90 days.
- We will avoid public disclosure until the vulnerability has been patched or the agreed disclosure deadline passes.

### 4.5 Public Disclosure

- After the vendor releases a fix, or after the end of a coordinated disclosure timeline, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability details.
- Public disclosures will be communicated in a clear, responsible manner without revealing exploit code unless deemed necessary.
- We may also include acknowledgments or credits for the vendor's response.

## 5. Exceptions

- If the vendor is unresponsive after multiple attempts over a reasonable time (typically 30 days), we may escalate internally to assess risks and consider responsible public disclosure.
- Immediate disclosure may be warranted if the vulnerability is actively exploited and no mitigation is available.

## 6. Legal Considerations

- Reporters must avoid unauthorized access or actions that violate laws or terms of service.
- Disclosures must respect legal constraints and ethical guidelines.

## 7. Contact for Reporting Vulnerabilities Found at [Organization Name]

While this policy covers outbound disclosure, we encourage vendors and researchers to report vulnerabilities found in [Organization Name] products via:

- Email: security@[organization domain]
- PGP Key: Available at [link]
- Bug bounty program: [if applicable]

## 8. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as needed to reflect changes in best practices and organizational priorities.
