**Refined Statement:**

We demonstrate that a meta-learning agent can rapidly adapt to and defeat a stronger non-meta-learning opponent in simulated robot wrestling. Additionally, we show that the meta-learning agent can effectively adjust to simulated physical malfunctions, highlighting its robustness and adaptability in dynamic environments.
