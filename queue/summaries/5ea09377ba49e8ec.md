Thanks for the summary! If you’d like, I can provide:

- A detailed explanation of the **CaberNet architecture** and how the global feature gate works.
- Insights into the **causal inference framework** and how invariant Markov blanket representations are learned.
- The **domain-wise training scheme** and how it stabilizes generalization across domains.
- Details on the **experiments** setup, metrics, and interpretations of the results.
- Help with understanding or reproducing the code from their GitHub repo.

Please let me know which part interests you the most or if you have a specific question!
