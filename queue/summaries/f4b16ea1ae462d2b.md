"Trading Inference-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness" refers to strategies in machine learning, particularly in deploying neural networks, where additional computational resources are used during the inference phase (i.e., when making predictions) to improve the model's robustness against adversarial attacks.

### Background
Adversarial robustness is the ability of a model to resist adversarial examples—inputs that have been intentionally perturbed in subtle ways to cause the model to make incorrect predictions. Traditionally, enhancing robustness often involves training-time techniques such as adversarial training, or designing robust architectures.

However, improving robustness can sometimes come at the cost of higher computational requirements during training or even inference.

### What Does "Trading Inference-Time Compute" Mean?

Typically, neural networks run inference as efficiently as possible, minimizing compute to reduce latency and cost. The idea of "trading inference-time compute" involves intentionally spending more computation during inference to achieve better robustness. This trade-off can manifest in several ways:

- **Multiple Forward Passes:** Instead of a single forward pass, the model may run several passes with different noise perturbations or randomized input transformations and then aggregate the results for a robust prediction.

- **Adaptive Computation:** The model may dynamically adjust its compute (e.g., using early-exit branches, iterative refinement, or ensemble models) to verify or refine predictions to detect or defend against adversarial inputs.

- **Test-Time Optimization:** Running a small optimization process during inference (e.g., input purification, projection onto a manifold) to undo potential adversarial perturbations.

- **Stochastic Defenses:** Introducing randomness at inference time, running multiple stochastic inference-time variants, and ensembling to dilute the effect of adversarial perturbations.

### Benefits

- Improved adversarial robustness without needing extensive retraining.
- Flexibility in deployment: models can scale inference compute depending on desired robustness-performance tradeoff.
- Potential to keep base model small and efficient, adding robustness only when needed.

### Downsides

- Increased latency and energy consumption at inference time.
- More complex inference pipelines.
- May complicate real-time or resource-constrained deployments.

### Example Papers and Approaches

1. **Randomized Smoothing:** A certified defense that applies Gaussian noise to inputs multiple times during inference, averaging predictions to certify robustness with probabilistic guarantees. This trades increased inference compute for a guarantee of robustness.

2. **Test-Time Defense via Optimization:** Approaches that optimize or refine inputs at inference to reverse adversarial perturbations.

3. **Ensemble Methods:** Using multiple models or subnetworks and combining outputs to improve robustness but increasing computations linearly with the number of components.

### Summary

"Trading inference-time compute for adversarial robustness" encapsulates the concept of deliberately increasing computational resources during the model's prediction phase to achieve stronger defenses against adversarial attacks. It contrasts with strategies emphasizing training-time modifications or static architectures by focusing on adaptive, possibly more expensive inference processes to verify, correct, or ensemble predictions for robustness.
