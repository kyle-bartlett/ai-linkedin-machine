Thanks for the detailed summary of **TRADES** from arXiv:2502.07071v3! It indeed highlights an important advancement in synthetic LOB simulation with transformer-based diffusion models.

If you want, I can assist with something specific like:

- **Explaining the TRADES architecture** and how the transformer and diffusion model are combined.
- **Walking through the adapted predictive score metric**, including how training on synthetic and testing on real data reflects generative model quality.
- **Discussing how TRADES achieves improvements over SoTA models**, in terms of architecture or training procedure.
- **Exploring the DeepMarket framework** setup, API usage, and integration with TRADES models.
- **Details about the synthetic LOB dataset** characteristics and how to use it for your experiments.
- Possible **extensions or applications** of TRADES in quantitative finance or algorithmic trading.

Let me know which aspect you want to dive into or if you need code examples, conceptual explanations, or help with running the provided framework!
