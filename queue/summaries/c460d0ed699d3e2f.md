Thank you for the clear and detailed summary! Your overview nicely captures the core advancements and significance of the Angular Graph Fractional Fourier Transform (AGFRFT).

If you want, I can help with:  
- Explaining the **mathematical formulation** of AGFRFT (e.g., fractional powers of Laplacian and the degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix).  
- Discussing the detailed **algorithmic steps** to compute AGFRFT and its inverse.  
- Providing **code implementations** (e.g., in Python with NumPy/SciPy) to help apply AGFRFT on sample graphs or signals.  
- Or help you analyze or extend AGFRFT for specific applications like denoising or feature extraction.

Just let me know which part interests you most!
