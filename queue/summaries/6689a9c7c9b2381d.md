**Collectively Governing AI: Innovations, Insights, and the Path Forward**

We recently funded 10 diverse teams across the globe to design innovative ideas and tools aimed at collectively governing artificial intelligence. These projects explore new models of collaboration, transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement, addressing the complex challenges posed by rapidly advancing AI technologies.

### Key Innovations
- **Collaborative Platforms:** Tools that enable multi-stakeholder deliberation and decision-making on AI deployment and regulation.
- **Transparent AI Auditing:** Systems designed to provide open, verifiable assessments of AI behavior and impact.
- **Adaptive Governance Frameworks:** Flexible policies that can evolve alongside AI capabilities and societal needs.
- **Inclusion and Equity Mechanisms:** Approaches ensuring marginalized voices are meaningfully integrated into AI governance.

### Learnings
- Collective governance requires bridging technical expertise with societal values.
- Trust-building is foundational; transparency and openness foster participation.
- Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential—legal, ethical, technical, and community perspectives must intertwine.
- Scalability and adaptability remain central challenges as AI systems proliferate globally.

### Call to Action
We invite researchers, engineers, policymakers, and community leaders passionate about the responsible development and governance of AI to join us. Together, we can build tools and frameworks that ensure AI benefits all of humanity while mitigating harms.
