Thank you for the clear and thorough summary of the paper **arXiv:2502.02054v2**! To add to your overview, here are some additional insights and possible discussion points:

### Additional Insights:
- **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) Benefits:**  
  IRL helps infer the underlying reward function that explains expert behaviors, which can generalize better than behavior cloning (which directly mimics actions) or naive RL (which requires extensive reward engineering and exploration). This reward function can be reused or adapted across different environments.

- **Motion Primitive Usage:**  
  Leveraging motion primitives to generate diverse expert trajectories is a clever choice: it systematically covers possible state-action combinations and reduces reliance on scarce expert demonstrations, improving robustness.

- **Sim-to-Real Transfer Without Fine-Tuning:**  
  The zero-shot transfer capability is notable. Many vision-based learning methods struggle with domain shift between simulation and reality (differences in sensor noise, lighting, textures). Their approach likely incorporates domain randomization or robust visual feature extraction, though confirmation from the paper would be helpful.

- **Potential Limitations or Future Work:**  
  - Computational overhead of IRL compared to direct RL or BC?  
  - How well does the policy handle unforeseen obstacles or dynamic environments?  
  - Scalability of the approach to more complex missions, longer flights, or different drone platforms?  
  - Is there reliance on specific sensor setups or camera configurations?

### Possible Questions for Deeper Understanding:
- How exactly is the reward function parameterized and learned in the IRL framework?  
- What is the architecture of the visual perception pipeline used to process raw images into features for planning?  
- How is the motion primitive planner integrated with the learned policy at inference time?  
- What simulation environments and visual realism techniques were used for training?
