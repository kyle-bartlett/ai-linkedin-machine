The paper arXiv:2511.16375v1 presents a thorough evaluation of foundation models—specifically Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN—for the task of corporate bankruptcy prediction. The authors conduct experiments on large and highly imbalanced datasets comprising over one million company records from the Visegrád Group.

Key points from the work:  
- It is the first systematic benchmarking of large foundation models against established classical machine learning methods (like XGBoost and CatBoost) for bankruptcy forecasting.  
- Results show that classical methods consistently outperform the foundation models across various prediction time horizons.  
- Large language model–based methods demonstrate unreliable probability estimations, which is a significant drawback in financial risk applications where calibrated risk scores are critical.  
- Although TabPFN shows some competitive performance compared to simpler baselines, its high computational cost and resource demands do not justify its marginal performance improvements.  
- The authors conclude that despite the broad applicability of foundation models, specialized machine learning techniques remain superior for the specific task of bankruptcy prediction as of now.

This study highlights important limitations of foundation models in specialized financial risk tasks and suggests caution in replacing traditional, well-understood methods without thorough empirical validation.
