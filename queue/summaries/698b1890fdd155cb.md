It sounds like RL-Teacher is designed to facilitate training reinforcement learning (RL) agents using human feedback instead of relying solely on manually designed reward functions. This approach aligns with research directions aiming to improve AI safety and address challenges in specifying reward functions that accurately capture desired behaviors.
