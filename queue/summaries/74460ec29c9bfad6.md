That sounds like a fascinating approach! Encouraging AIs to teach each other using carefully selected, informative examples could significantly improve their learning efficiency and interpretability. By automatically selecting the best examples—such as the most representative images of dogs—your method likely helps AIs grasp concepts more clearly and consistently.

If you’re interested, I can help you discuss or elaborate on:

- How your example selection process works (e.g., criteria, algorithms).
- Experimental setup and evaluation metrics used to test effectiveness.
- Potential applications or implications for AI interpretability and collaborative learning.
- Ways to extend the method to other modalities or concepts.
