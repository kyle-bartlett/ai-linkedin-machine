It sounds like there have been recent leadership updates at OpenAI:

- **Mira Murati** has been announced as the new **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)**.
- **Greg Brockman** is returning as **President**.
- There are messages from **CEO Sam Altman** and **board chair Bret Taylor** as well.

If you'd like, I can help summarize or provide the full text of those messages, or give more context about the leadership changes. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
