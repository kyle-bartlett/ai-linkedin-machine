The paper **arXiv:2508.00996v2** presents an updated deep neural network model for inclusive electron-carbon scattering. The authors build upon their previous bootstrap model [Phys. Rev. C 110 (2024) 2, 025501] by incorporating both recent experimental data and older measurements in the deep inelastic scattering region. This leads to a re-optimized posterior model with improved predictions and uncertainties.

Key points of the update include:

- Use of new and older experimental data to refine the model.
- Adoption of a Bayesian approach with the bootstrap model as a prior.
- Analysis of how the updated data sets influence model predictions.
- Evaluation of cross-section predictions specifically in the kinematic range important for neutrino experiments like Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE.

This improved modeling is relevant for interpreting electron-nucleus scattering and has direct implications for neutrino oscillation experiments where accurate nuclear target cross sections are essential for reducing systematic uncertainties.
