Thanks for the detailed summary of **iLTM** from arXiv:2511.15941v1! This sounds like a very interesting and promising approach to tabular data modeling, especially given its integration of tree-based insights and neural network flexibility.

If you'd like, I can help with:

- A deeper explanation of the individual components (e.g., tree-derived embeddings, meta-trained hypernetwork, retrieval mechanisms).
- How the pretraining and fine-tuning stages are designed and why they matter.
- Comparisons between iLTM and other leading tabular models like GBDTs or recent deep learning approaches (e.g., TabNet, FT-Transformer).
- Potential use-cases or practical implications of adopting iLTM in industry or research.
- Discuss limitations, open challenges, or future directions suggested by the paper.

Just let me know what aspect you want to dive into!
