That sounds like a promising initiative! Supporting countries to develop AI systems with democratic principles in mind can help ensure AI technologies are aligned with values such as transparency, fairness, inclusivity, and accountability.

If you're looking to develop or describe such an initiative, here are some key components and approaches you might consider:

### Key Objectives
- **Promote Transparent AI**: Encourage the development and use of AI systems whose decision-making processes are explainable and interpretable to users and stakeholders.
- **Ensure Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: Support frameworks that actively detect and mitigate biases in AI models to prevent discrimination against any individual or group.
- **Enhance Accountability**: Create mechanisms for holding developers and deployers of AI systems accountable for their impacts, including legal and ethical guidelines.
- **Foster Public Participation**: Involve diverse communities and stakeholders in AI governance to reflect varied perspectives and needs.
- **Build Capacity and Infrastructure**: Provide technical and educational resources to empower countries to build AI systems responsibly.
- **Encourage Open Collaboration**: Promote open standards, shared research, and international cooperation on democratic AI development.

### Possible Components
- **Policy Guidance and Frameworks**: Develop and disseminate best practice guidelines or model policies for democratic AI.
- **Technical Assistance and Training**: Offer workshops, courses, and toolkits to governments and organizations.
- **Funding and Resources**: Create grant programs or partnerships to support local AI research and infrastructure.
- **Multi-stakeholder Dialogues**: Organize forums where policymakers, technologists, civil society, and academia can collaborate.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Establish metrics and tools to assess AI systems’ alignment with democratic values.

### Examples and Inspiration
- The **OECD AI Principles**, which promote inclusive growth, human rights, transparency, and robustness.
- The **AI for Good** initiatives by the United Nations.
- Regional efforts like the **European Union's AI Act**, focusing on human-centric and trustworthy AI.
