Thanks for the summary! This paper sounds like a great advancement in hardware design verification by leveraging LLMs guided directly by coverage metrics.

If you're interested, we can dive deeper into any of these aspects:

- **How CD-DPO works:** The exact training loop, how coverage metrics are incorporated as a preference signal, and how it differs from traditional RLHF or other fine-tuning methods.  
- **Details on PairaNet:** How the dataset was constructed, what kinds of stimuli/testbenches it includes, and how coverage labels are obtained.  
- **Comparison with baseline methods:** What baseline techniques they compare against, and why those baselines are important/representative.  
- **Potential limitations and future work:** Possible challenges in scaling, generalizing to other hardware domains, or integrating this into full verification pipelines.  
- **Implications for hardware design automation:** How this approach could transform verification workflows or influence hardware design cycles.

Just let me know which area you want clarification or elaboration on!
