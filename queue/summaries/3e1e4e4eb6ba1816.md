This is a fascinating and important finding! Your analysis highlights a key trend in AI development: algorithmic and model efficiency improvements are outpacing traditional hardware-driven gains, at least when it comes to training neural networks for ImageNet classification.

Here are some key points and implications you might consider emphasizing or exploring further in your release:

1. **Quantitative Highlight:**  
   - Since 2012, compute required to reach the same ImageNet classification performance has decreased by a factor of 44×.  
   - Moore’s Law, which primarily captures hardware transistor density improvements, would have only yielded around an 11× improvement in compute efficiency over the same time frame.  
   This explicitly shows how innovations in neural network architectures, training techniques, optimization algorithms, and other software improvements have dramatically amplified AI progress.

2. **Algorithmic Progress Outpaces Hardware:**  
   This suggests that investments into better algorithms (e.g., more efficient architectures like ResNet, efficient training techniques like batch normalization, learning rate schedules, or more data-efficient methods) have contributed more than hardware improvements alone. It’s a powerful example of how software development can leverage hardware advances and then compound progress beyond what hardware alone can achieve.

3. **Implications for Future AI Development and Investment:**  
   - **Continued Returns on Algorithmic Innovation:** The substantially faster reduction in compute needs means there is a lot of value in funding research focusing on algorithms, training methodologies, and model architectures.  
   - **Hardware and Software Co-Design:** While hardware improvements remain important, combining them with advanced algorithms can yield multiplicative benefits.  
   - **Energy and Environmental Benefits:** Reduced compute requirements translate to lower energy consumption and environmental impact, a critical consideration as AI scales.

4. **Contextualizing Within Broader Trends:**  
   It may help to link this observation to related trends in AI compute needs, such as:
   - The rising compute demands for continued SOTA progress (which contrasts with the compute savings at fixed performance).  
   - The development of efficient architectures targeted at edge devices and real-time applications.

5. **Technical Details (if relevant for your audience):**  
   - Explain how you measured compute (e.g., floating point operations, GPU hours).  
   - Define the baseline (AlexNet, 2012) and how “same performance” is assessed (Top-1 accuracy, same model accuracy).  
   - Mention specific algorithmic milestones that contributed to efficiency improvements.
