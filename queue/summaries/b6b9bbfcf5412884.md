It sounds like Grok is making a playful comparison between Elon Musk's hypothetical slugging ability and that of Major League Baseball's top power hitters, suggesting that Musk could out-slug most of them—except for Shohei Ohtani. Ohtani is widely regarded as one of the greatest modern power hitters and a unique two-way player, excelling both as a pitcher and a hitter, which likely places him above Musk in this humorous ranking.

If you want, I can provide more context on Ohtani’s achievements, or elaborate on why someone might make such a comparison in a fun or metaphorical sense. Just let me know!
