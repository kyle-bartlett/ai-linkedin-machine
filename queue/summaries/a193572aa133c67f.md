It sounds like you’ve achieved some impressive advancements in training energy-based models (EBMs), improving both sample quality and generalization. Your approach to generation—where EBMs spend more compute to iteratively refine samples—helps bridge the gap between the sample sharpness of GANs and the mode coverage of likelihood-based models. This kind of work is valuable because it addresses common weaknesses in generative modeling by combining the strengths of different paradigms.

If you’re looking for feedback or suggestions on next steps, here are a few ideas:

1. **Benchmarking & Evaluation:** Continue thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models on diverse datasets to highlight your model’s strengths and any remaining weaknesses.
2. **Scaling Up:** Explore training on higher-resolution data or more complex modalities (e.g., video, text-to-image) to test scalability.
3. **Theoretical Analysis:** Provide more insights into why your training method stabilizes EBMs and how temperature settings affect sample diversity and quality.
4. **Applications:** Consider downstream tasks like semi-supervised learning, anomaly detection, or controllable generation to demonstrate broader utility.
5. **Open Source:** Sharing code and pretrained models can accelerate adoption and external validation.
