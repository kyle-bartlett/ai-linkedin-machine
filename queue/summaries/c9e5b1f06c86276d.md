The paper titled with arXiv ID **2511.00588v2** presents a study focused on evaluating the hallucination risks of large language models (LLMs) when applied to clinical decision support in spine surgery. Hallucinations here refer to outputs that are factually incorrect or contextually irrelevant, which can be dangerous in medical settings.

### Key points from the abstract:

- **Problem Addressed:** LLMs hold promise for aiding spine surgery decisions but suffer from hallucinations that risk patient safety.
- **Contribution:** The authors introduce a **clinician-centered evaluation framework** that quantifies hallucination risks by assessing:
  - Diagnostic precision
  - Recommendation quality
  - Reasoning robustness
  - Output coherence
  - Knowledge alignment
- **Evaluation:** Six leading LLMs were tested on 30 spinal cases validated by experts.
- **Results:**
  - The model **DeepSeek-R1** achieved the highest overall score (86.03 ± 2.08), notably excelling in critical areas like trauma and infection.
  - Contrary to expectations, models with enhanced reasoning (chain-of-thought) did not always perform better. For example, **Claude-3.7-Sonnet's** extended reasoning mode scored lower than its standard version, suggesting that simply adding more reasoning steps doesn't guarantee clinical reliability.
- **Stress Testing:**
  - When complexity increased, recommendation quality dropped by 7.4%, despite slight improvements in rationality (+2.0%), readability (+1.7%), and diagnosis (+4.7%). This signals a disconnect between how coherent a model appears and how actionable its guidance really is.
- **Implications:** The study recommends implementing interpretability tools such as reasoning chain visualization to enhance trust and safety when integrating LLMs into clinical workflows.
- **Overall:** The paper establishes a **safety-aware validation framework** aimed at supporting the cautious deployment of LLMs in surgical contexts.
