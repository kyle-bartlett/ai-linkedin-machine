OpenAI has shared an update on its collaborative efforts with the US Center for AI Safety and Innovation (CAISI) and the UK’s Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (AISI) aimed at advancing AI safety and security. This partnership focuses on establishing new benchmarks for the responsible deployment of frontier AI technologies. Key initiatives under this collaboration include:

- **Joint Red-Teaming:** Coordinated adversarial testing of AI models to identify vulnerabilities and mitigate risks before deployment.
- **Biosecurity Safeguards:** Implementing measures to prevent misuse of AI in biological contexts, ensuring safety against bio-related threats.
- **Agentic System Testing:** Evaluating AI systems with autonomous capabilities to ensure they operate within safe and controllable parameters.

Together, these efforts contribute to setting higher standards for responsible AI development and deployment, helping to promote safer, more secure applications of advanced AI technologies globally.
