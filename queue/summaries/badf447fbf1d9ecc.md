That sounds like a valuable and timely contribution! Social scientists bring crucial insights into human behavior, cognition, and social dynamics that can greatly enhance AI alignment research—especially when it comes to designing systems that effectively interact with real people. If you'd like, I can help with some next steps such as:

- Suggestions for framing the paper’s key arguments for different audiences (academic, policy, public)
- Ideas for outreach to social science communities or interdisciplinary workshops
- Drafting a job description or recruitment materials for the social scientist roles at OpenAI
- Brainstorming collaboration models between ML and social science researchers

Let me know how I can assist!
