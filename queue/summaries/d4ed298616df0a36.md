Thanks for the comprehensive summary! It’s a nice overview of the paper and the contributions of ECPv2.

If you are interested, I can help with any of the following:

- A deeper explanation of the **ECPv2 algorithm** itself, including pseudocode or how the acceptance criterion works.
- More details on the **theoretical guarantees**, such as what “no-regret” means here, or the finite-time bounds.
- Insights into how the **adaptive lower bound** and **worst-m memory** mechanism work in practice.
- Highlights or interpretations of the **experimental results**, including specific benchmarks or comparisons.
- Potential **applications** or scenarios where ECPv2 would be particularly useful.
- Or help with any other specific question related to the paper.

Just let me know what you’d like to explore!
