That sounds like a great use case for AI! OpenAI’s technology can help automate the extraction of key information from contracts—such as dates, parties involved, payment terms, obligations, and renewal clauses—which significantly reduces manual review time. By quickly parsing and structuring contract data, teams can access critical details more efficiently, leading to faster decision-making and improved operational workflows. If you're interested, I can provide more information about how such systems typically work or how to implement one using OpenAI’s models. Would you like that?
