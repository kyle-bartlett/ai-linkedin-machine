That sounds like a valuable and impactful initiative! Here are some ideas and steps you might consider to facilitate the development of AI-powered cybersecurity capabilities for defenders through grants and other support:

### 1. Define Clear Objectives
- **Identify specific challenges** in cybersecurity where AI can add significant value (e.g., threat detection, anomaly detection, automated incident response).
- Set **measurable goals** for the grants program (e.g., number of projects funded, types of solutions developed, real-world impact).

### 2. Develop a Structured Grants Program
- **Eligibility Criteria:** Define who can apply (startups, academic researchers, nonprofits, security professionals).
- **Application Process:** Create a transparent and accessible application process.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Evaluate projects based on innovation, feasibility, scalability, and impact on defenders.
- **Funding Amounts:** Provide tiered funding options (seed, growth, scaling stages).

### 3. Offer Technical and Strategic Support
- Provide **technical mentorship** from cybersecurity and AI experts.
- Facilitate **access to cybersecurity datasets**, computational resources, and tools.
- Offer **workshops and training** on cutting-edge AI and cybersecurity topics.
- Create a **community or network** to foster collaboration among grantees.

### 4. Encourage Collaboration
- Promote partnerships between **industry, academia, and government**.
- Facilitate **information sharing** about emerging threats and AI methods.
- Encourage joint development and **open-source contributions** when appropriate.

### 5. Measure and Share Impact
- Track progress through **regular reporting** and milestone reviews.
- Highlight success stories and case studies to inspire others.
- Share insights and lessons learned with the broader cybersecurity community.

### 6. Explore Other Support Mechanisms
- Provide **hackathons, challenges, and competitions** with rewards.
- Offer **access to pilot programs** with defenders to test solutions in real environments.
- Advocate for policies and frameworks that promote AI innovation in cybersecurity.
