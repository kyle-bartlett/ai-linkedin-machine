It sounds like you’re interested in implementing a system where a model can offer automatic discounts based on inputs it has recently encountered. Could you please clarify a bit more about the context? For example:

- Are you building a pricing or recommendation system using machine learning?
- What kind of inputs are these (e.g., user data, product IDs, discount codes)?
- What do you mean by "recently seen" — recent sessions, recent purchases, recent queries?
- Are you looking for a technical approach, an algorithm, or a conceptual framework?

With a bit more detail, I can provide a more targeted answer. However, here’s a general approach you might consider:

### General Concept for Automatic Discounts Based on Recently Seen Inputs

1. **State or Cache Recent Inputs:**
   - Maintain a short-term memory/cache of recent user inputs or relevant data points. For example, keep track of products the user has viewed or purchased in the last X minutes or sessions.
  
2. **Define Discount Rules or Models:**
   - Create rules that trigger discounts when certain conditions are met, e.g., a user looking at the same item multiple times, or adding it repeatedly to cart but not purchasing.
   - Alternatively, use a model (such as a classification or recommendation model) to predict the likelihood of purchase or discount sensitivity, dynamically adjusting to recent user behavior.

3. **Incorporate Recency in Model Inputs:**
   - When scoring or generating outputs, the model can take as input not just the current item/user state, but also features representing recent interactions.

4. **Implementation Ideas:**
   - Use a sliding window over recent inputs with timestamps.
   - Use a key-value store or session storage for quick lookups.
   - Employ reinforcement learning or multi-armed bandits to optimize discount offers over time based on response.

5. **Example Use Case:**
   - If user views product A multiple times within a session, automatically offer discount X% to nudge the purchase.
   - If a user redeems a specific coupon code recently, reduce offering redundant discounts.
