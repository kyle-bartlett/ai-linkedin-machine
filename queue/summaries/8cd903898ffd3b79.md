Prompt injections are a type of security attack targeting AI systems, especially large language models, by manipulating the input prompts to cause the AI to behave in unintended or malicious ways. These attacks can trick the AI into revealing sensitive information, bypassing content filters, or executing harmful instructions embedded within user inputs.

### How Prompt Injection Attacks Work

- **Embedding Malicious Instructions:** An attacker crafts input that looks innocent but contains hidden commands. For example, in a conversation, a user might insert instructions that override prior safety constraints.
- **Context Manipulation:** Since language models generate responses based on all provided context, attackers can inject prompts that change or negate earlier instructions.
- **Exploiting Model Behavior:** Language models aim to follow user instructions, so carefully phrased prompts can exploit this to bypass restrictions or trigger unintended outputs.

### OpenAI's Approaches to Mitigation

OpenAI is actively researching and implementing multiple strategies to address prompt injection risks:

1. **Robust Training:** Models are continually trained with datasets that include examples of malicious prompt attempts, improving their ability to recognize and reject harmful instructions.
2. **System-Level Safeguards:** Building guardrails into the AI’s architecture to detect and prevent harmful prompt manipulations before the model processes them.
3. **User Policy Enforcement:** Implementing strong usage policies and monitoring systems to limit the impact of prompt injections.
4. **Ongoing Research:** Collaborating with the security community to understand prompt injection vectors and develop new defensive techniques.
5. **Prompt Design Best Practices:** Encouraging developers and users to structure prompts carefully, layering instructions to reduce vulnerabilities.

By combining these methods, OpenAI aims to create AI systems that are both powerful and safe, minimizing risks from prompt injection attacks while maintaining usability.
