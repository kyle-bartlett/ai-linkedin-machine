That’s a great initiative from OpenAI! Offering a free year of ChatGPT Plus to U.S. servicemembers and veterans within 12 months of retirement or separation can provide valuable support during a major life transition. With enhanced access to GPT-4 capabilities, ChatGPT Plus can assist with:

- Crafting and refining resumes tailored to civilian job markets  
- Preparing for interviews with practice questions and tips  
- Exploring education and training opportunities  
- Planning career goals and next steps post-service  

If you or someone you know is eligible, it’s definitely worth taking advantage of this resource to ease the transition and open up new opportunities. If you want, I can help with resume writing or interview preparation!
