That sounds like a fascinating advance! Could you please provide more details about the new techniques you used for scaling sparse autoencoders? Also, how did identifying these 16 million patterns help in understanding or improving GPT-4's computations? I'd be interested in learning more about the methodology and the implications of this work.
