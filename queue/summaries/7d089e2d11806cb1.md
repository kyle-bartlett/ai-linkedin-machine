That's correct. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where an adversary crafts input to manipulate the model into ignoring or bypassing its original instructions. These attacks can lead the model to generate unintended, harmful, or otherwise unauthorized outputs, which presents significant security and safety challenges.

To mitigate such risks, some common strategies include:

- **Prompt sanitization:** Filtering or preprocessing inputs to detect and remove potentially malicious content.
- **Robust instruction tuning:** Training models to better adhere to safety guidelines even when faced with adversarial inputs.
- **Context management:** Structuring conversations or prompts so that injected text has less influence on the model's behavior.
- **Access controls and monitoring:** Restricting who can interact with the model and continuously monitoring generated outputs for suspicious behavior.
- **Model architecture improvements:** Researching techniques that make models inherently more resistant to manipulation.

Despite these efforts, prompt injection remains an active area of research as attackers develop increasingly sophisticated methods. Continuous vigilance and improvement are necessary to reduce risks associated with these attacks. Would you like more detailed information on any of these mitigation strategies?
