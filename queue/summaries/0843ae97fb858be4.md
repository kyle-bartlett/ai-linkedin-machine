The paper (arXiv:2511.13984v2) introduces a framework for detecting errors in SQL queries generated by large language models (LLMs) by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). The method works in two main stages:

1. **Node-level labeling**: A semantically aware algorithm compares a generated SQL query with a gold reference query to assign correctness labels to nodes in the AST, while avoiding over-penalizing structural container differences or alias naming variations.

2. **Node representation and classification**: Each node is encoded with schema-aware and lexical features (e.g., identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, scope ambiguity, typos). A supervised classifier is then trained on these features to predict the probability that each node is erroneous.

The node-level error probabilities serve as calibrated uncertainty estimates that enable precise diagnostics of where errors lie in the SQL query.

Key outcomes:

- The approach significantly outperforms traditional token-level log-probability confidence measures, improving average Area Under Curve (AUC) scores by +27.44% across multiple databases and datasets.

- The method is robust to cross-database evaluation scenarios.

- The fine-grained uncertainty signals can support error correction, human-in-the-loop checking, and selective execution of query parts.

Overall, this work proposes a novel, interpretable way to assess the correctness of LLM-generated SQL at a granular level, providing a more informative confidence metric than aggregate sequence-level scores typically used.
