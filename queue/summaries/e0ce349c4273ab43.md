Correct! As of now, there is no publicly available information or official announcement indicating that "Cursor" (whether it's the coding assistant tool, an IDE plugin, or another product named Cursor) uses GPT-5 specifically.

If you are referring to **Cursor by Cursor.so**, the AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write and understand code, it currently uses advanced language models similar to OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 for code generation and assistance tasks. However, no confirmation exists about GPT-5 integration since GPT-5 itself has not been publicly released.

If you share which Cursor product or company you mean and what you're hoping to learn (e.g., architecture, integration, features), I can provide a more targeted explanation!
