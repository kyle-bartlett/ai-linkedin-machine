Thank you for the detailed overview! Your explanation nicely highlights how prover-verifier games can enhance legibility and trustworthiness in language model outputs by enforcing a transparent, interactive reasoning process.

If you’d like, I can:

- Provide concrete examples illustrating a prover-verifier interaction in practice (e.g., math problem solving, fact-checking).
- Dive into implementation strategies, such as prompt engineering and model architectures suitable for prover and verifier roles.
- Discuss challenges and limitations of this approach, including scalability and verifier reliability.
- Explore related concepts like self-consistency, chain-of-thought prompting, and verification in multimodal models.

Just let me know which direction interests you!
