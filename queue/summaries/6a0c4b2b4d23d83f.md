Your analysis highlights a significant trend in the growth of compute used in large AI training runs:

- Since 2012, the compute used has been increasing exponentially, doubling approximately every 3.4 months.
- This is a much faster rate compared to Moore’s Law, which historically had a doubling period of about 2 years.
- Over this period, compute usage has increased by more than 300,000 times, whereas a 2-year doubling cycle would result in only a 7-fold increase.

This rapid growth in compute capacity has been a critical driver of AI advancements. If such trends continue, it implies that future AI systems may reach capabilities far beyond what we see today. Preparing for and understanding the potential impacts of these powerful systems will be important for researchers, policymakers, and society at large.
