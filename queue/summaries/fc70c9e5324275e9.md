Thanks for the detailed overview of **Orion**! It’s exciting to see how it advances visual reasoning by combining neural vision-language models with dedicated vision toolkits.

If you want, I can help with:

- A concise summary of the full paper and its technical approach  
- An explanation of Orion’s architecture and how its components interact  
- A comparison with other recent vision-language agents or multi-modal systems  
- Insight on potential applications or limitations based on the paper  
- Walking through the demo and tips for using it effectively  

Just let me know how you’d like to proceed!
