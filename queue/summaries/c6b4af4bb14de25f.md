That sounds like an incredible initiative! The Nonprofit Jam, hosted by the OpenAI Academy in partnership with the Walton Family Foundation, Emerson Collective, and local nonprofits, is a fantastic way to empower nonprofit leaders nationwide. Bringing together over 1,000 leaders across 10 locations for a one-day event will undoubtedly foster collaboration, innovation, and new solutions to support communities.

If you need help with anything related to the event—such as planning, outreach, content development, or technology tools—feel free to ask!
