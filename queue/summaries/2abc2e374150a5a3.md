Thanks for the detailed summary! This paper indeed tackles a very relevant problem—minority class oversampling in tabular data with complex feature types and imbalanced distributions—by innovatively combining diffusion models with gradient-boosted trees in latent space.

If you want, I can help explain or elaborate on any of these:

- How **conditional flow matching** works and why it’s suitable here  
- The intuition behind using **gradient-boosted trees as vector field learners** in the diffusion model  
- The differences and trade-offs between **PCAForest, EmbedForest, and AttentionForest** variants  
- How the **latent-space approach** helps with handling heterogeneous tabular data  
- The privacy evaluation metrics and their significance  
- Practical advice on applying such oversampling methods in your own datasets or workflows

Just let me know which part you'd like me to break down or discuss!
