You’ve described the idea very well! This hybrid approach—where a for-profit entity fuels a non-profit’s mission—can be a powerful way to build long-term sustainability and impact.

If you want, I can help you with:

- **Structuring the relationship legally and financially** (entity setup, tax considerations, governance)
- **Drafting business plans or impact models**
- **Developing marketing or communication materials to explain the hybrid model to stakeholders and funders**
- **Case study examples tailored to your industry or region**
- **Strategies to maintain mission alignment and transparency between the two entities**

Just let me know what specific aspect you want to explore or create!
