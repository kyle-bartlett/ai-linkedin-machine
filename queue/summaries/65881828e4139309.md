- Explain Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and how it balances question difficulty, diversity, and answer quality  
- Discuss the training procedure and experimental setup used to validate VisPlay  
- Analyze quantitative and qualitative results from the paper  
- Compare VisPlay with existing approaches for vision-language reasoning and self-improvement  

Just let me know which part you want to dive into!
