Thanks for sharing the summary of the paper (arXiv:2509.23928v2) on HiViS! Here’s a concise breakdown and a bit more reflection on its contributions and significance:

### What HiViS achieves:
- **Addresses a key bottleneck in multimodal speculative decoding:**  
  Vision-language models incorporate complex visual inputs represented as *visual tokens*, which considerably increase computational overhead during inference. Prior speculative decoding methods focused mainly on text-only LLMs, making direct application to VLMs inefficient or even unstable.

- **Key insight—Visual tokens are often redundant:**  
  Not all visual tokens are equally important for generation quality. Many contribute little to the semantic outcome and thus can be safely omitted from the drafter’s direct attention.

- **HiViS approach:**  
  Instead of having the drafter (a smaller or faster model that drafts completions) directly handle the visual tokens, **HiViS "hides" these visual tokens during drafting.**  
  - The drafter only processes **textual tokens**, drastically reducing its input length.  
  - Visual semantics are incorporated *implicitly* via the computations of the larger target VLM acting as a **semantic fusion oracle** during training.  
  - The drafter learns to produce proposals aligned with the final model’s outputs through a **time-step-aware aligned training scheme** that uses bias-correction residuals. This correction ensures the drafter stays semantically consistent without access to explicit visual tokens.

- **Outcomes:**
  - Achieves **longer acceptance lengths** in speculative decoding (more tokens are accepted from the drafter without rejection).  
  - Provides higher **speedup ratios**, meaning inference is significantly faster and more efficient.  
  - Maintains or improves the quality of multimodal language generation.

### Why this is important:
- Vision-Language Models are becoming ubiquitous but pose real challenges due to large inputs (e.g., many image patches or region tokens). Efficient decoding critically impacts applications like captioning, visual question answering, and multimodal chatbots.  
- Speculative decoding is a promising method to speed up autoregressive generation, but naively extending it to VLMs is infeasible because costly visual tokens explode complexity.  
- HiViS introduces a practical and elegant way to leverage speculative decoding in VLMs by sidestepping the burden of visual token processing in the drafter, all while preserving semantic alignment via intelligent training.

### Potential follow-ups or interests:
- How generalizable is HiViS across different vision encoder architectures (e.g., CNNs, ViTs) and modalities beyond images (e.g., video, 3D)?  
- Could the idea of "hiding" certain tokens be extended to other costly modalities or token types in multimodal models?  
- Exploring the limits of bias-correction residuals in maintaining semantic fidelity with increasing token hiding.
