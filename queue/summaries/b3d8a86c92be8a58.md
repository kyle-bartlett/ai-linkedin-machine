Thank you for sharing your findings. It’s encouraging that your models provide at least some incremental capabilities, even if limited, in addressing malicious cybersecurity tasks involving state-affiliated threat actors. If you’d like, I can help you explore ways to enhance your models’ effectiveness, suggest additional analytical approaches, or discuss best practices for threat detection and account termination strategies. How would you like to proceed?
