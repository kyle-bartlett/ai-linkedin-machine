Khan Academy has been exploring the potential of GPT-4 through a limited pilot program aimed at enhancing personalized learning experiences. By integrating GPT-4, Khan Academy seeks to provide students with more interactive, customized, and responsive educational support. This pilot involves using GPT-4 to assist with tutoring, answering questions, and generating tailored explanations that adapt to individual learning styles.

The goal of this initiative is to supplement human teachers and existing resources, helping students better understand complex concepts and practice skills at their own pace. Khan Academy is also attentive to ensuring that the use of AI aligns with educational values such as accuracy, equity, privacy, and safety, and is actively monitoring the outcomes and feedback from the pilot to guide future implementations.
