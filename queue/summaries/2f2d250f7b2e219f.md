That sounds like an exciting release! Procgen Benchmark’s set of 16 procedurally-generated environments is a great resource for evaluating reinforcement learning agents’ ability to quickly learn and generalize skills across varied settings.

If you want, I can help you draft an announcement, provide an overview of the environments, suggest best practices for using the benchmark, or discuss how it compares to other benchmarks. Just let me know!
