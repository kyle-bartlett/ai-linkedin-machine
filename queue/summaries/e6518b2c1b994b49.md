The paper with arXiv ID **2209.12746v3** introduces a novel approach to improve image inversion techniques by focusing on the alignment between inverted latent codes and the synthetic latent distribution. Here's a summary of its main contributions and context:

### Context and Problem
- **Image Inversion**: The task of embedding a real image into the latent space of a generative model (like StyleGAN) to enable editing and reconstruction.
- This usually has two stages:
  1. **Image Embedding**: Encoding the input image to obtain a latent code.
  2. **Result Refinement**: Improving the reconstruction quality from the latent code.
- While refinement improves **fidelity** (how closely the reconstructed image matches the original), **perception** (visual quality) and **editability** (ease and fidelity of edits applied in latent space) are still limited by the quality of the initial latent code.
- The key challenge: Obtain latent codes that preserve reconstruction fidelity but also improve perceptual quality and editability.

### Key Insight
- Perception and editability are closely linked to how aligned or misaligned the latent code is with the **synthetic latent distribution** (the distribution of latent codes the generator is trained on).
- Misaligned codes may cause poor perceptual quality and difficulty in editing.

### Contributions
1. **Latent Space Alignment Inversion Paradigm (LSAP)**:
   - A framework that aims to achieve better alignment between inverted latent codes and the latent distribution.
   
2. **Normalized Style Space and Metric**:
   - Introduces a new latent space called **Normalized Style Space (\(\mathcal{S}^N\) space)**.
   - Proposes the **Normalized Style Space Cosine Distance (NSCD)** to quantify the degree of misalignment.
   - NSCD serves as an evaluation metric correlating well with perceptual quality and editability.
   
3. **Unified Inversion Solution**:
   - The paradigm works for both encoder-based and optimization-based inversion methods.
   - Provides a consistent framework to optimize latent codes for better alignment.

### Results
- Experiments across multiple domains show that:
  - The NSCD metric effectively captures perception and editability aspects.
  - LSAP achieves state-of-the-art results in both stages (embedding and refinement), improving fidelity without sacrificing perception or editability.

### Summary
This work advances image inversion by explicitly addressing the alignment of latent codes to the generator's latent space distribution, introducing measurable metrics and a unified paradigm that enhances both inversion fidelity and downstream editing capabilities.
