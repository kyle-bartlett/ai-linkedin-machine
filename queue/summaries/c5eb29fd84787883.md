GitHub has introduced a new feature that allows you to view the pull request description directly on the "Files changed" tab. This means you no longer have to scroll back to the top, switch tabs, or lose context while reviewing code changes. This update, available as a public preview starting November 20, enhances the pull request review experience by keeping all relevant information in one place.

For more details, you can read the official announcement on the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-11-20-pull-request-files-changed-public-preview-november-20-updates).
