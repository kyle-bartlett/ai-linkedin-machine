  "summary_raw": "We show that the\u00a0double\u00a0descent\u00a0phenomenon\u00a0occurs in CNNs, ResNets, and transformers: performance first improves, then gets worse, and then improves again with increasing model size, data size, or training time. This effect is often avoided through careful regularization. While this behavior appears to be fairly universal, we don\u2019t yet fully understand why it happens, and view further study of this phenomenon as an important research\u00a0direction.",
