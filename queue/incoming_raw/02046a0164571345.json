We\u2019re calling for research and investment in six security measures that we believe will play key roles in protecting advanced AI.\n\nProtecting, exploring, and applying advanced artificial intelligence (AI) is our strategic imperative. OpenAI\u2019s mission is to deliver positive impact of advanced AI to everything from healthcare to science to education \u2013 and yes, even to cybersecurity. That work begins with building secure, trustworthy AI systems and protecting the underlying technologies from those who seek to subvert our work to cause harm.",
