  "summary_raw": "We\u2019ve trained an agent to achieve a high score of 74,500 on\u00a0Montezuma\u2019s Revenge\u00a0from a single human demonstration, better than any previously published result. Our algorithm is simple: the agent plays a sequence of games starting from carefully chosen states from the demonstration, and learns from them by optimizing the game score using\u00a0PPO, the same reinforcement learning algorithm that underpins\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0Five.",
