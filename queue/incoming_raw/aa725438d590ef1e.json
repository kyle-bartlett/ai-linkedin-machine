  "summary_raw": "Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models that an attacker has intentionally designed to cause the model to make a mistake; they\u2019re like optical illusions for machines. In this post we\u2019ll show how adversarial examples work across different mediums, and will discuss why securing systems against them can be difficult.",
