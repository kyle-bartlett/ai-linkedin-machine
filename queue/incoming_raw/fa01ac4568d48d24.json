This paper examines integrating quantum computing across the drug development cycle to accelerate and enhance workflows and rigorous decision-making. It highlights quantum approaches for molecular simulation, drug-target interaction prediction, and optimizing clinical trials. Leveraging quantum capabilities could accelerate timelines and costs for bringing therapies to market, improving efficiency and ultimately benefiting public health.",
