  "summary_raw": "We've trained a model to achieve a new state-of-the-art in mathematical problem solving by rewarding each correct step of reasoning (\u201cprocess supervision\u201d) instead of simply rewarding the correct final answer (\u201coutcome supervision\u201d). In addition to boosting performance relative to outcome supervision, process supervision also has an important alignment benefit: it directly trains the model to produce a chain-of-thought that is endorsed by humans.",
