  "summary_raw": "arXiv:2511.16613v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We study community detection in the \\emph{symmetric $k$-stochastic block model}, where $n$ nodes are evenly partitioned into $k$ clusters with intra- and inter-cluster connection probabilities $p$ and $q$, respectively.\n  Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax-optimal misclassification rate\n  \\begin{equation*}\n  \\exp \\Bigl(-\\bigl(1 \\pm o(1)\\bigr) \\tfrac{C}{k}\\Bigr),\n  \\quad \\text{where } C = (\\sqrt{pn} - \\sqrt{qn})^2,\n  \\end{equation*}\n  whenever $C \\ge K\\,k^2\\,\\log k$ for some universal constant $K$, matching the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold up to a $\\log k$ factor.\n  Notably, this rate holds even when an adversary corrupts an $\\eta \\le \\exp\\bigl(- (1 \\pm o(1)) \\tfrac{C}{k}\\bigr)$ fraction of the nodes.\n  To the best of our knowledge, the minimax rate was previously only attainable either via computationally inefficient procedures [ZZ15] or via polynomial-time algorithms that require strictly stronger assumptions such as $C \\ge K k^3$ [GMZZ17].\n  In the node-robust setting, the best known algorithm requires the substantially stronger condition $C \\ge K k^{102}$ [LM22].\n  Our results close this gap by providing the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax rate near the KS threshold in both settings.\n  Our work has two key technical contributions:\n  (1) we robustify majority voting via the Sum-of-Squares framework,\n  (2) we develop a novel graph bisection algorithm via robust majority voting, which allows us to significantly improve the misclassification rate to $1/\\mathrm{poly}(k)$ for the initial estimation near the KS threshold.",
