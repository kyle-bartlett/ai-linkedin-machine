Existing methods for solving noisy inverse problems in IR, considers the pixel-wise data-fidelity. In this paper, we propose SaFaRI, a spatial-and-frequency-aware diffusion model for IR with Gaussian noise. Our model encourages images to preserve data-fidelity in both the spatial and frequency domains, resulting in enhanced reconstruction quality. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our model on a variety of noisy inverse problems, including inpainting, denoising, and super-resolution. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates that SaFaRI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ImageNet datasets and FFHQ datasets, outperforming existing zero-shot IR methods in terms of LPIPS and FID metrics.",
