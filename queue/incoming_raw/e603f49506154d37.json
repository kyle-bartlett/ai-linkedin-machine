  "summary_raw": "We\u2019ve created MuseNet, a deep neural network that can generate 4-minute musical compositions with 10 different instruments, and can combine styles from country to Mozart to the Beatles. MuseNet was not explicitly programmed with our understanding of music, but instead discovered patterns of harmony, rhythm, and style by learning to predict the next token in hundreds of thousands of MIDI files. MuseNet uses the same general-purpose unsupervised technology as\u00a0GPT-2, a large-scale\u00a0transformer\u00a0model trained to predict the next token in a sequence, whether audio or\u00a0text.",
