Variants of this problem include handling outliers, employing alternative distance functions such as M-estimators, weighting distances to achieve balanced clustering, or enforcing unique cluster assignments. For any $\\varepsilon > 0$, an $\\varepsilon$-coreset is a weighted subset $C \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$ that approximates $D(\\mathcal{S},X)$ within a factor of $1 \\pm \\varepsilon$ for any set of $k$ centers, enabling efficient streaming, distributed, or parallel computation. We propose the first coreset construction that provably handles arbitrary input segments. For constant $k$ and $\\varepsilon$, it produces a coreset of size $O(\\log^2 n)$ computable in $O(nd)$ time. Experiments, including a real-time video tracking application, demonstrate substantial speedups with minimal loss in clustering accuracy, confirming both the practical efficiency and theoretical guarantees of our method.",
