  "summary_raw": "We\u2019ve created\u00a0activation atlases\u00a0(in\u00a0collaboration\u00a0with Google researchers), a new technique for visualizing what interactions between neurons can represent. As AI systems are deployed in increasingly sensitive contexts, having a better understanding of their internal decision-making processes will let us identify weaknesses and investigate\u00a0failures.",
