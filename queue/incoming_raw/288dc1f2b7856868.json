  "summary_raw": "We\u2019ve developed the Sparse Transformer, a deep neural network which sets new records at predicting what comes next in a sequence\u2014whether text, images, or sound. It uses an algorithmic improvement of the\u00a0attention\u00a0mechanism to extract patterns from sequences 30x longer than possible\u00a0previously.",
