ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{\\\"i}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times r},\\ B\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times r}$ with $r\\ll \\min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.",
