Unlike traditional vision-language models that generate descriptive outputs, Orion orchestrates a suite of specialized computer vision tools, including object detection, keypoint localization, panoptic segmentation, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and geometric analysis, to execute complex multi-step visual workflows. The system achieves competitive performance across MMMU, MMBench, DocVQA, and MMLongBench while extending monolithic VLM capabilities to production-grade visual intelligence. Through its agentic, tool-augmented approach, Orion enables autonomous visual reasoning that bridges neural perception with symbolic execution, marking the transition from passive visual understanding to active, tool-driven visual intelligence.\n  Try Orion for free at: https://chat.vlm.run\n  Learn more at: https://www.vlm.run/orion",
