Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.",
