  "summary_raw": "We\u2019re developing a blueprint for evaluating the risk that a large language model (LLM) could aid someone in creating a biological threat.\u00a0In an evaluation involving both biology experts and students, we found that GPT-4 provides at most a mild uplift in biological threat creation accuracy. While this uplift is not large enough to be conclusive, our finding is a starting point for continued research and community deliberation.",
