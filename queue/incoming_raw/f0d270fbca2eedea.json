  "summary_raw": "We\u2019re releasing highly-optimized GPU kernels for an underexplored class of neural network architectures: networks with block-sparse weights. Depending on the chosen sparsity, these kernels can run orders of magnitude faster than cuBLAS or cuSPARSE. We\u2019ve used them to attain state-of-the-art results in text sentiment analysis and generative modeling of text and images.",
