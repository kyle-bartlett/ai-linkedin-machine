While there have been larger language models released since August, we\u2019ve continued with our original staged release plan in order to provide the community with a test case of a full staged release process. We hope that this test case will be useful to developers of future powerful models, and we\u2019re actively continuing the conversation with the AI community on responsible\u00a0publication.",
