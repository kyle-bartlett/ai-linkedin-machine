  "summary_raw": "I\u2019ve always considered myself a pragmatic technologist\u2014someone who loves technology not for its own sake, but for the direct impact it can have on people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s what makes this job so exciting, since I believe AI will unlock more opportunities for more people than any other technology in history.
