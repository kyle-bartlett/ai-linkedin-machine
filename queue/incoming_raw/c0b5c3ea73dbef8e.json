However, many real-world systems -- such as biological or social networks -- feature multi-way interactions that GNNs fail to capture. Topological Deep Learning (TDL) addresses this by modeling and leveraging higher-order structures, with Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks (CCNNs) offering a general and expressive approach that has been shown to outperform GNNs. However, TDL lacks the principled and standardized frameworks that underpin GNN development, restricting its accessibility and applicability. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized CCNNs (GCCNs), a simple yet powerful family of TDL models that can be used to systematically transform any (graph) neural network into its TDL counterpart. We prove that GCCNs generalize and subsume CCNNs, while extensive experiments on a diverse class of GCCNs show that these architectures consistently match or outperform CCNNs, often with less model complexity. In an effort to accelerate and democratize TDL, we introduce TopoTune, a lightweight software for defining, building, and training GCCNs with unprecedented flexibility and ease.",
