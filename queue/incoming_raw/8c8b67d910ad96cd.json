  "summary_raw": "We\u2019re releasing CoinRun, a training environment which provides a metric for an agent\u2019s ability to transfer its experience to novel situations and has already helped clarify a\u00a0longstanding\u00a0puzzle\u00a0in reinforcement learning. CoinRun strikes a desirable balance in complexity: the environment is simpler than traditional platformer games like Sonic the Hedgehog but still poses a worthy generalization challenge for state of the art\u00a0algorithms.",
